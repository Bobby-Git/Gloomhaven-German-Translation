compendium_activebonuses_1,"Some card actions may contain an active bonus effect that applies until either the end of the round or a condition is met. These cards appear in the active section of a character's hand until the effect runs out. The active bonus' card is then discarded or burned depending on the icon at the bottom right-hand corner of the action as usual.

While an active bonus is in effect, there will be an entry alongside the character portrait in the initiative tracker at the top of the screen. Hovering over this active bonus icon will display the effect details and its XP tracker, if any - these can also be seen in the character info panel displayed when hovering over a character.

The duration icons that accompany active bonuses are as follows:"
compendium_activebonuses_2,"<b>Round Bonus</b>
This icon within an action indicates that the effect applies only until the end of the current round."
compendium_activebonuses_3,"<b>Persistent Bonus</b>
This icon within an action indicates that the effect applies until the accompanying condition is met (if no condition is specified, then it lasts until the end of the scenario!) Some persistent bonuses are accompanied by an XP tracker, indicating that XP is gained at certain instances of the condition being met, which can be checked in the initiative bar entry for the bonus.

compendium_attackmodifiers_1,"When attacking, the base attack value written on the card can be modified by three types of values in the following order. These steps are repeated for each individual enemy targeted by the attack:

• An attacker’s attack modifiers are applied first. These modifiers include bonuses and penalties from active ability cards, items, and other sources (e.g., +1 Attack from Poison).

• Next, an attack modifier card is drawn from the attacker’s attack modifier deck and applied. This appears above the attack recipient's health bar as the attack is happening. The attack modifier cards can be seen by hovering over a character to show their information panel, with the blips next to each modifier showing how many remain in the deck. The deck is reshuffled when the standard <b><color=#A050E0>x0</color></b> or <b><color=#D92727>x2</color></b> cards are drawn."
compendium_attackmodifiers_2,"• Lastly, the defender’s defensive bonuses are applied. This reduces the incoming attack value for each individual enemy targeted based on each defender’s own shield modifier or other defensive bonuses.

• Note that because the bonuses are applied per target, it is possible for the same attack action to ultimately deal different damage to each enemy it targets."

<b>4. Default Actions

In addition to the main action on each card half, all ability cards have basic default actions that can be used instead. The default actions are the same for all cards: <b>Attack 2</b> for the top action, and <b>Move 2</b> for the bottom action."

For player characters, use of consumes is optional. They can be toggled on or off at any point before the action is carried out by clicking on the element icon(s) of the consume within the action, provided each element required is available. In the case of Any element, you will be prompted to select one from those available.

However, a card's action may have the following symbols at the bottom right-hand corner:"

• If, at the beginning of a round, a player cannot play two cards from his or her hand (because they have one or fewer cards in hand) and also cannot rest (because they have one or fewer discarded cards). Exhaustion due to insufficient cards does not affect a character’s current hit point total.

In either case, the character is removed from the scenario, and can no longer participate in the scenario in any way. There is no coming back from being exhausted during a scenario, and thus it should be avoided at all costs. If all characters become exhausted during a scenario, the scenario is lost. It is therefore recommended that you try to not let this happen!"

compendium_gainingexperience_2,"Sometimes the action's text specifies that experience is only earned by consuming an elemental infusion by having it as part of the on-consume effect, or only if a certain condition is met (e.g. only if the attacked target is adjacent to one or more of the attacker’s allies) Some persistent active bonuses grant experience when a certain instance of that bonus' trigger condition is reached, as denoted by their accompanying tracker. (See <b>Active Bonuses</b>)

Only at the end of the turn will the element infuse fully into the Strong state. As such, it is not possible to infuse an element and then consume it within the same character's turn - but may be consumed by anyone later in the initiative order of the same round.

Once all player characters and monsters have selected their cards for the turn, the initiative track at the top of the screen is updated and ordered accordingly - going from lowest initiatives taking their turns first and highest last.

compendium_loot_1,"A <b>Loot X</b> ability allows a character to pick up every money token and treasure tile within range X. This action is unaffected by the positions of monsters or obstacles, but note this is considered a ranged ability for the purposes of line-of-sight."
compendium_loot_2,"In addition to the Loot ability, at the end of their turn, a player character will automatically loot any gold on the hex that they occupy. Summoned characters do not perform end-of-turn looting.

compendium_meleeandranged_1,"An <b>Attack X</b> ability allows a character to do a base X amount of damage to an enemy within their range. Characters and monsters cannot attack their allies. There are two types of attacks, Melee and Ranged:"
compendium_meleeandranged_2,"Melee attacks have no accompanying range value and are considered to have a default range of one hex, which means they typically target adjacent enemies."
compendium_meleeandranged_3,"Ranged attacks are accompanied by a <b>Range Y</b> value, which means any enemy within Y hexes can be targeted by the attack. Any ranged attack targeting an adjacent enemy gains Disadvantage against that target. (See <b>Advantage and Disadvantage</b>)"
compendium_meleeandranged_4,"All ranged and melee attacks can only be performed against enemies within line-of-sight, which means that a line can be drawn from any corner of the attacker’s hex to any corner of the defender’s hex without touching any part of a wall. Only walls block line-of-sight. In addition, any ability which specifies a range can only be performed on a character within line-of-sight. If a non-attack ability does not specify a range, then line-of-sight is not required. Also note that two hexes separated by a wall line are not considered adjacent, and range cannot be counted through walls."

compendium_monsterattacks,"A monster will attack on its turn if an <b>Attack</b> ability is part of its drawn card for the round. Any damage dealt is calculated from the attack value present on the ability.

Monsters will always attack their focused enemies but if the monster can attack multiple targets, it will attack its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible to maximum effect. If a monster has multiple attacks, it will choose the focus of its other attacks following normal focus rules, excluding targets it is already attacking.

Monster attacks function exactly like character attacks, and are modified by the attacker’s attack bonuses, then attack modifier cards, then the defense bonuses of their target, and they may be performed with <b>Advantage</b> or <b>Disadvantage</b>."
compendium_monsterattacks_title,Monster Attacks
compendium_monsterfocus,"Before performing the action on their ability card, each individual monster will focus on a specific enemy to it - either a character or character summon.

A monster will focus on the enemy it can perform its current attack against using the least amount of movement. It finds the shortest possible path to get in range and line-of-sight to use its attack, and the enemy that can be attacked at the end of that path is the focus. This enemy is considered the “closest.” It doesn’t matter if the monster can’t get within range to attack with its current movement, as long as there is a path to eventually get within range. 

If a monster does not have an attack listed on its ability card for the round, it finds a focus as if it had a melee attack. In the case where the monster can move the same number of spaces to get within range and line-of-sight of multiple enemies (e.g., because it starts its turn within range of multiple), proximity from the monster’s current position (not counting through walls) is then checked as a tie-breaker for determining “closest.”

If more than one enemy ties for being the closest, the second priority is to focus on the enemy who is earlier in the initiative order (summons are focused on before the character who summoned them in this regard, even on the round they are summoned).

In the case where there are no valid targets on which to focus, because there are no valid hexes a monster can attack from (i.e., they are all blocked, occupied, or there is no open path to reach them), regardless of the number of hexes it could move, a monster will not move or attack on its turn, but it will perform any of the other actions on its ability card that it is able."
compendium_monsterfocus_title,Monster Focus
compendium_monstermovement_1,"A monster can move on its turn if a <b>Move</b> is present on its ability card. It can move up to a number of hexes equal to the move value. 

If a monster has a move but no attack afterward as part of its ability card, it will use its movement to get as close as possible to its focused target (determined as if it had a melee attack), moving along the shortest possible path to enter a hex adjacent to its focused enemy.

If a monster has an attack ability after its movement, it will move the least number of hexes possible in such a way as to attack its focused enemy with maximum effect. If it is a single-target melee attack, it will simply move toward the nearest hex adjacent to its focus to attack. If it is a multi-target attack, it will move toward a position where its attack will hit its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible."
compendium_monstermovement_2,"If the monster is performing a ranged attack, it will only move toward a hex where it is within range to perform its best possible attack. A monster will also move away from its focused enemy until it can perform the ranged attack without <b>Disadvantage</b>. When forced to choose, a monster will prioritize losing <b>Disadvantage</b> on its focused enemy over maximizing its attack on secondary targets."
compendium_monstermovement_3,"Even if a monster cannot move into attack range, it will still use its movement to get as close as possible to its focus. Having abilities other than <b>Attack</b> on its ability card does not affect a monster’s movement in any way. It will simply move according to the above rules and then use its other abilities as best as it can."
compendium_monstermovement_4,"Monsters without the <b>Flying</b> trait consider negative hexes (e.g. ones with traps) to be obstacles when determining focus and movement unless movement through one of these hexes is the only way they can focus on a target. In this case, they will use the path moving through the smallest number of negative hexes possible to find a focus and suffer any consequences."
compendium_monstermovement_title,Monster Movement
compendium_monsterturns,"Monsters’ decisions are controlled by a focus system using action cards to automate what the monsters will do on their turn. All monsters will perform the abilities listed on their drawn card for the round in the order written. They will not move or attack unless these actions are listed on their card.

Monster cards for the round are drawn per monster type, not per monster. This means that all ""Bandit Archers"" for example would all act out the same abilities for each of their turns. 

All elites of a monster type act first, then the normal monsters of that type act. If more than one elite or normal monster of a given type is present on the board, then the monsters act in ascending numerical order. All monsters of the same type take individual turns, not all together, at the same initiative value listed on their drawn monster card for the round."

compendium_movementtypes_1,"<b>Move X</b> abilities allow a character to move up to X number of hexes on the map. Characters and monsters can move through their allies, but cannot move through their enemies or obstacles. Traps can be moved through and are triggered when their tile is entered with normal movement. Movement cannot end in the same hex as another character or monster. Walls can never be moved through."
compendium_movementtypes_2,"<b>Jump</b>
Some Move abilities are specified as a <b>Jump</b>. A jump move allows the character to ignore all characters, monsters, obstacles and traps during their movement. However, the last hex of a jump is still considered a normal movement, and so must obey the normal movement rules above - so as much as you may want to land on top of Cragheart, you cannot."
compendium_movementtypes_3,"<b>Flying
</b>
Some monsters may also have the <b>Flying</b> special trait. This allows them to completely ignore any characters, monsters, traps and obstacles during any part of their movement, including the last hex, except that they must still end their movement in an unoccupied hex (no characters or monsters present). This includes forced movement like a Push or Pull. If a character loses its Flying trait while occupying an obstacle hex, it takes damage as if it had sprung a damage trap and then moves immediately to the nearest empty hex."

compendium_multipletargets_1,"Some attacks are accompanied by a <b>Target X</b> value, which means the character can target X different enemies within the attack’s range with the attack."

Attacks can never target allies. An ally can be within the affected area of an attack, but they will not be targeted by it."

compendium_negativeconditions_1,"Certain abilities may apply conditions to their targets. The condition remains until the requirements for removing the specific effect are met. Only one of each condition type may be applied to any single character or monster at a time, however conditions can be reapplied to refresh their duration.


The following are negative conditions. If an ability has the name of one of these conditions contained within it, then the condition is applied to all targets of the ability, after the main effect of the ability is applied. Conditions on an attack are applied regardless of whether the attack does damage."
compendium_negativeconditions_2,"<b>POISON:</b> If a target is poisoned, all enemies add +1 <b>Attack</b> to all of their attacks targeting them. If a <b>Heal</b> ability is used on a poisoned target, the poison condition is removed, but has no other effect (i.e. does not restore any hit points)."
compendium_negativeconditions_3,"<b>WOUND:</b> If a target is wounded, it suffers one point of damage at the start of each of its turns. If a <b>Heal</b> ability is used on a wounded target, the Wound condition is removed and the <b>Heal</b> continues normally. If a target is both poisoned and wounded, a <b>Heal</b> ability would remove both conditions but have no other effect."
compendium_negativeconditions_4,"<b>IMMOBILIZE:</b> If a target is immobilized, it cannot perform any <b>Move</b> abilities on its turn. At the end of its next turn, the immobilize condition is removed."
compendium_negativeconditions_5,"<b>DISARM:</b> If a target is disarmed, it cannot perform any <b>Attack</b> abilities on its turn. At the end of its next turn, the Disarm condition is removed."
compendium_negativeconditions_6,"<b>STUN:</b>  If a target is stunned, it cannot perform any abilities or use items on its turn (except to perform a long rest in the case of characters). At the end of its next turn, the Stun condition is removed.

A retaliate bonus can also be accompanied by a <b>Retaliate Range Y</b> value, which means that the retaliate effect triggers instead to any attacker within Y hexes, rather than just adjacent hexes. The retaliate takes effect after the attack that initiated it.

If the retaliating character is killed or exhausted by the attack, then the retaliate does not activate. Multiple retaliate bonuses stack with one another, and retaliate itself is not an attack or even a targeted effect, it is simply direct damage to the attacker's hit points."

compendium_roundsummary,"A scenario consists of a series of rounds that are played until players either meet the victory conditions of the scenario or fail the scenario. A round consists of the following phases:

• <indent=15><b>1. Ability Card Selection:</b>
For each character, either select two cards for the round or choose to perform a long rest for the round. The first card selected determines the character's initiative for the round. (Short rests may also be performed during card selection to recover discarded cards)</indent>

• <indent=15><b>2. Monster Cards Revealed:</b>
For each monster type currently in play a card for the round is revealed. All monsters of a type will use the same card for the round. The initiative track at the top of the screen is then updated based on the initiative values of the chosen character and monster cards.</indent>

• <indent=15><b>3. Action Phase:</b>
Starting with the lowest initiative, players and monsters will act out their turns for the round. While monsters simply act out their single-action cards, player characters select which two opposing card-halves to use at the start of their turn. Player characters may also use item cards at various points during their turns.</indent>

• <indent=15><b>4. End of Round:</b>
Round-length active effects end and where appropriate are discarded or burned, infused elements go from strong to waning and waning to inert, and if a standard <b><color=#A050E0>x0</color></b> or <b><color=#D92727>x2</color></b> multiplier was drawn as a modifier that modifier list is reset.</indent>"

compendium_selectingcards,"At the beginning of the round, either two ability cards or a long rest must be selected for each player character to use for their turn.

The cards selected will determine the set of actions you have available at the beginning of each character's turn, as well as the character's initiative for the round. A large part of the strategy in Gloomhaven is choosing the right combination of cards wisely for their abilities and initiative.

Note that while each card has two halves, opposite halves must be used for the turn. For example, if you choose to use the top half of a card for the first action of a character's turn, the bottom half must be used for the other."
compendium_selectingcards_title,Selecting Cards
compendium_shield,A <b>Shield X</b> active bonus ability gives the recipient a defensive effect that reduces any incoming attack value by X. Multiple shield bonuses stack with one another and can be applied in any order. A shield bonus only applies to damage caused by an attack - direct damage such as from traps or retaliate is not attenuated.
compendium_shield_title,Shield
compendium_summon,"Some abilities summon allies to assist you. Summons are placed in an empty hex adjacent to the character performing the summon. If there are no available hexes, the summon ability cannot be used.

Summons have basic statistics for hit points, attack value, move value, and range value along with any special traits written on the ability card. A summon is considered a persistent bonus (the card is placed in the active area) until either the summon loses all its hit points, its corresponding ability card is removed from the active area, or the summoner becomes exhausted, at which point the summon disappears. 

A summon’s turn in the initiative order is always directly before the character who summoned it, and is separate from that character’s turn. Summons are not controlled by the summoning player, but instead obey automated monster rules, permanently performing <b>Move X, Attack Y</b>, where X and Y are its base move and attack values respectively. Summons use the player’s attack modifier deck to perform its attacks.

A player can have multiple different summon abilities in play at once, in which case they act in the order in which they were summoned. Summoned characters never take a turn in the round they are summoned. Summon kills are credited to the owner of the summon."

compendium_takingdamage,"Whenever a player character takes damage in any form, you are presented with three options:

• <indent=15><b>1. Take the damage:</b> The character loses hit points equal to the value shown.
</indent>
• <indent=15><b>2. Burn a card from hand:</b> Choose an available card from your hand to be burned instead of receiving the damage.
</indent>
• <indent=15><b>3. Burn two discarded cards:</b> Choose two cards from your discarded cards to be burned instead of receiving the damage.
</indent>
Note that choosing to negate the damage by either of the burning cards options does not prevent any additional effects from the attack from being applied. You also cannot choose to burn the cards you have selected for the turn if you have not used them yet.

<b>TIP:</b> It is often wise to use your health as a resource and opt to lose hit points over burning cards when you can, as you often can recoup lost hit points via resting and abilities more easily than you can recover burned cards!"

compendium_traps,"A trap is sprung when a character enters its hex with normal or forced movement. Flying and Jump movements are unaffected by traps. When a trap is sprung, it inflicts some negative effect on the character who sprung it and then it is removed from the board. A trap can also be disarmed through specific actions to remove it from the board without suffering its negative effects.

Trap effects are varied and can be seen by hovering over the trap. Characters and monsters can also create traps on the board, with the effects specified by the ability that creates the trap."

compendium_usingabilites,"At the start of a player character's turn, you are presented with the two cards you chose for the turn. You can now choose the first action to use for the two actions a player character can perform in a turn - bearing in mind that the main action or default action from the opposite card half on the other card will then have to be your second action.

Within each action are one or more abilities, which are acted out in the order that they appear on the card - although you can opt to skip some abilities provided that the effect is not negative. Here's an example breakdown of the abilities in the bottom action of Crater in the attached screenshot:

• <indent=15>Firstly, all adjacent allies and enemies suffer one damage.</indent>

• <indent=15>Next up is the ability to move up to four hexes as a jump. Note that ""Jump"" here is not another ability in itself, but rather a property of the Move ability. You can identify such properties and effects of abilities as they will be in a smaller font beneath the ability.</indent>

• <indent=15>Finally, there is another instance of damage to all adjacent allies and enemies. Notice that underneath is an option to consume the element Earth (See <b>Elements</b>) to augment this ability to deal two damage instead of one and gain XP. Note that this consume option only applies to the latter instance of damage that directly precedes it on the card.</indent>

• <indent=15>After all three of the abilities are complete, there is 1 XP to be gained from the floating symbol for it within the action, and due to the burned icon in the corner of the card, the card is burned instead of being discarded for choosing this action.</indent>"

compendium_usingitems_1,"The icon to use an item glows to indicate when they can be used, according to the constraints of what is written on the item card. You can use the items from these equip slots by clicking on them at these times. Some items will only be usable from in the Take Damage UI, and will appear above it when applicable. There are also items that provide a constant passive effect for as long as they are equipped and thus do not require activation to apply.

Note that if an item affects an attack (e.g. adds a bonus, an effect, advantage, etc), it will only be available to be used before the attack is committed - i.e. before the attack modifier for the attack is drawn. If an effect is added to an attack, it functions exactly as if it had been written on the action card being used for the attack. There is no limit to the number of items a character can use on their turn or even during a specific ability, provided the item is still available to be spent. Any instance of applying the effects of an item card to a situation is considered a use.

There are three different things that can happen to an item card after it is used, denoted by the following:"
compendium_usingitems_2,"This symbol means that the item is <b>Spent</b> after use, and cannot be reused in this scenario until it is refreshed, by either a long rest or an ability's effect."
compendium_usingitems_3,"This symbol means that the item is <b>Consumed</b> after use, and can only be refreshed within a scenario by specific abilities. All items are refreshed between scenarios, and no item can be permanently consumed."

You continue down the road, disappointed that you hadn't come across the cart earlier when the food was still edible."

As you turn to leave, your stomach suddenly starts to gurgle and growl loudly. A few moments later, and you find yourself keeled over in the bushes, vomiting profusely.

Perhaps you'll think twice next time before consuming mysteriously abandoned food."
event_abandonedcart_eat_strengthen,"The food in the barrel is far superior to the supplies you brought with you - soft loaves of seeded bread, strips of dry-cured meat, fresh fruits and vegetables - a true feast! You fashion a hearty meal from the barrel's contents and eat your fill.

'Oh! Well met, fellow travellers,' he says, nodding his head in greeting. He looks over at his cart and smiles. 'Thank you for not stealing from my cart while I was... preoccupied. Y'know, I have more food than I could possibly eat back there - you're welcome to join me for a meal.'

You accept the man's offer and partake in a meal far superior to the meagre supplies you brought with you. You finish your meal and part ways with the kind man, invigorated by the fine meal you consumed."

“Hey, over here! Please, help me!”

There’s a note of desperation in their voice, and a pained groan as the stranger waves to get your attention. However, beneath the tree’s shadow, you can’t quite make out who or what they might be.

Before you can ask her what she means, she snaps her fingers and disappears, and with her all of the cave paintings - only rough-hewn rock remains.

You tentatively sneak over to the origin of the scream to find a female Valrath, and in front of her a dead man beside an open grave. He is wearing a torn dark cloak, often worn by cultists, and you can see from his wounds that he had a bloody and violent death.

The Valrath woman is wearing a magnificent necklace and dress typical of Valrath high society, bulky and colorful.  Something seems amiss however, as you notice the dress is moth-eaten, she has dirt in her hair and her trembling hand is clutching a knife with fresh blood dripping from it."

event_bloodyvalrath_rob,"She turns as if to fight, but upon seeing she is outnumbered, she begrudgingly accepts. She hands over the necklace, cursing and spitting at you with words you have never heard from the mouth of a Valrath before.

You notice the inscriptions on the necklace match the epitaph on the gravestone above the empty grave... perhaps her name?

You can see the parchment has the designs for something on it, but still—you recognize this Harrower. It is known for trading in disreputable goods. You can’t know where that parchment came from, and if anyone saw you dealing with this creature...well, they might get the wrong idea."

Standing at the far end of the wooden planks is a group of Lurkers—terrifying crab-like monsters as big as an Inox and equally ferocious. Except these Lurkers don’t appear to be hostile. They are simply standing on the dock, clacking their claws in a strange rhythm."

Before you can react, he draws his sword. “You...
what did you do?”

You look and see that, due to the fall, your clothes are now covered in blood. The guard clearly thinks you are responsible for the man’s death. This night just took a serious turn for the worse."

Ahead of you in the street, you see a pair of guards scuffling with a young boy dressed in rags. “You snatch purses, you go to the Ghost Fortress. No way around that.”

“But my family is starving,” the boy cries. You recognize his voice from some of your dealings in the Sunken Market. He’s given you helpful tips for mercenary work on a number of occasions."

event_city_campaign_16_result_a_a,"You entreat the guards to let the boy go, but they are unmoved. With further pressing, they agree to do so only if you pay his criminal fine. The guards cuff the boy’s ear and set him free."
event_city_campaign_16_result_a_b,"You entreat the guards to let the boy go, but they are unmoved. It seems like you may be able to grease their palms
a bit, but, unfortunately, you do not have enough money to sway their minds. The boy is hauled off to the Ghost Fortress."
event_city_campaign_16_result_b,"There are repercussions to getting caught, and like the guard said, sometimes there’s no way out of it. You owe the boy nothing, and so let the guards take him away."
event_city_campaign_17_intro,"Returning to Gloomhaven with your latest haul of treasure, you
approach the market in search of a good trade. Unfortunately, there are only a few visible stands around that are not yet packing up for the day.

A robed Savvas catches your eye. It has a few strange artifacts on display, but you approach with no great expectation, hoping your goods will fetch a decent price.

The Savvas silently nods as you approach. It picks through your haul and lifts up a single item, holding out a small bag for you in exchange.

Pouring out the bag’s contents, a single rectangular black-and-white coin lands in your palm."
event_city_campaign_17_option_a,Demand a different payment. The single coin is an insult. 
event_city_campaign_17_option_b,Accept the strange coin and research it for hidden value. 
event_city_campaign_17_result_a,"You slam the strange coin back down onto the Savvas’ display in anger. It reaches out to grab the coin, but you take hold of its arm and demand a proper payment. Wordlessly, it looks at you with disdain and throws a handful of gold in your face. You shield your eyes and move to draw your weapon, but when you look around, the Savvas and its goods are no longer to be found. You sullenly gather the coins it threw and move on."
event_city_campaign_17_result_b,"You calmly assess that the coin may possess much more value than it appears to have. You head to the University and spend hours looking through old records to no avail. You end the day in a tavern, easing the frustration with a drink and loud laments about the coin. “Those markings are very interesting.” You look up to see an Aesther standing over you. “They describe a special meeting place. I can show you where.”"
event_city_campaign_18_intro,"You are attending to business in the Sinking Market when a frail white-haired woman approaches you and grabs you by the arm.

“Oh my, don’t you lot look strong,” she says. “Could you possibly assist me with a small problem I am having in my cellar?”

Her eyes grow narrow. “Rats! So many rats! I don’t know where they’re coming from, but they are a right nuisance. Ruined three jars of preserves just yesterday!”

She tugs weakly at your sleeve. “Please, can you help me?”"
event_city_campaign_18_option_a,Decline to help the old woman.
event_city_campaign_18_option_b,Agree to help with the rat infestation. 
event_city_campaign_18_result_a,"You pull your arm away from her filthy grasp and step away, making apologies for being too busy. Your excuses lack the proper tact, however, and soon the woman is bawling in the street, lamenting that no one will help her and how the rats will kill her in her sleep, then feast on her corpse. The whole speech is very graphic, and passersby begin to give you odd looks, wondering what you could have done to upset the poor woman so intensely."
event_city_campaign_18_result_b,"You smile broadly and ask the woman to lead you to her house. It is a ramshackle dwelling half sunk into the muddy foundation. And inside there are certainly a lot of rats. You kill as many as you can, but in her cellar you find a large hole leading to a section of sewer that recently collapsed, leaving the pests with nowhere else to go. The woman thanks you for at least helping her to be able to sleep tonight and hands you a few coins."
event_city_campaign_19_intro,"A curious invitation is slipped under your door in the early
morning. It is for a wedding ceremony between the children of two wealthy Gloomhaven merchants. Your exploits seem
to have placed you in their good graces, and so they would like you to join them on this special occasion, provided you don’t show up in blood-soaked armor.

And for the love of the Great Oak, bring a gift."
event_city_campaign_19_option_a,Attend the wedding with an expensive gift. 
event_city_campaign_19_option_b,Attend the wedding and bring a mundane gift. 
event_city_campaign_19_result_a_a,"You head to the New Market and find a magnificent vase to bring as a gift. When the father of the bride sees it, he declares it the most wonderful piece he’s ever encountered. You are the talk of the town."
event_city_campaign_19_result_a_b,"You bring a very expensive vase as a gift, but you can’t seem to catch the father of the bride’s eye to present it at the right time."
event_city_campaign_19_result_b_a,"You pick up an unremarkable set of silverware on the way to the event. When you arrive, the father of the bride casts a scornful look your way and begins whispering to those around him. Maybe you received the invitation by mistake."
event_city_campaign_19_result_b_b,"You are one guest among many, and everyone is having too good of a time to notice your poor choice in gifts."
event_city_campaign_1_intro,"You decide to unwind at the Sleeping Lion, but just as you are starting to relax, a bear of a man crashes into your table, scattering your drinks across the floor.

Towering over him is a massive Inox. “What did you say about my horns?” the Inox shouts. The man stands up and brushes shards of glass from his tunic. “I said the sight of them makes me want to vomit!”

The Inox roars and charges headlong into the man, crashing through more tables in the process. At this, the entire tavern erupts into violence. After all, when a man is deep into his drink, the last thing you want to do is knock that drink over."
event_city_campaign_1_option_a,Join the fray! These insults will not go unanswered!
event_city_campaign_1_option_b,Do your best to stop the fighting. This is a respectable establishment. 
event_city_campaign_1_result_a,"Nothing like busting some drunken skulls to lift one’s spirits. It turns out to be a great way to unwind. Unfortunately, the proprietor of the Sleeping Lion doesn’t exactly see it that way, and he sullenly asks for compensation for the damage you caused."
event_city_campaign_1_result_b,"After restraining the enraged Inox and offering to replace the drinks of a few of the more belligerent patrons, you calm the
place down a bit. Some of the non-human patrons are understandably on edge, but the proprietor thanks you for your efforts and reimburses you for the drinks."
event_city_campaign_20_intro,"You are relaxing at the Sleeping Lion when an immaculately dressed man approach your table, a fake smile plastered to his face.

“Ah, you must be the mercenaries everyone is talking about, yes? My name is Lord Greymane and I have a delicate matter to discuss. May I sit?”

You gesture to a chair and he sits with a faint grimace. “I am transporting some valuable goods this evening from one of my warehouses, and I have reason to believe that some of the less desirable elements of this city wish to steal from me. I would like to hire you to help guard the undertaking.”"
event_city_campaign_20_option_a,Agree to guard the goods. It should be easy money.
event_city_campaign_20_option_b,Politely decline. You have much better things to do tonight. 
event_city_campaign_20_result_a_a,"You head to the warehouse and watch in silence as a number of heavy crates are loaded onto a cart. You then escort the cart to the West Gate. No thefts are attempted, and you are paid well."
event_city_campaign_20_result_a_b,"You head to the warehouse and are immediately set upon by a group of thieves. However, they prove no match for
your expertise and are quickly dispatched. Greymane thanks you."
event_city_campaign_20_result_b,"This is your night off, and you are going to spend it drinking, not guarding some snobby “lord.”

In the morning, you hear news that a shipment of rare minerals bound for the capital was stolen in the night. People are calling it a huge blow to the economy of the town."
event_city_campaign_21_intro,"“I’ve been told you are the group to talk to if you want to get
something done around here.”

You look up from your table at the Sleeping Lion to see a rustic man in leather armor standing in front of you.

This tavern may as well be your office, due to the number of people coming through the doors looking for your help. You nod at the man, and he makes his request.

“My brother went out hunting in the Corpsewood two days ago and hasn’t returned since. I fear the worst. If you are traveling in that direction, I hope you wouldn’t mind keeping an eye out for him.”"
event_city_campaign_21_option_a,Demand payment up front before agreeing to look for the man's brother. 
event_city_campaign_21_option_b,Agree to help the man in his search. 
event_city_campaign_21_result_a_a,"“What? I... Oh, very well,” the man stutters. “Since I trust you to keep your word, I’ll give you a little money for your trouble.” The man describes his brother and hands you a small coin pouch."
event_city_campaign_21_result_a_b,"The man puffs up in indignation, letting you know he is insulted
by your behavior. He storms out of the tavern in a rage."
event_city_campaign_21_result_b,"The man thanks you profusely and gives a detailed description of his brother. “If you find him, no matter the condition, please let me know right away.”"
event_city_campaign_22_intro,"You decide to head to the Brown Door for the evening to enjoy a Quatryl concert.

Corruption and crime run rampant in the bar, but the music is unmatched in all of Gloomhaven.

You are enjoying yourself immensely when you catch a glimpse of a man in a dark, tattered robe near the back of the room. He appears to be handing vials full of red liquid to a second man."
event_city_campaign_22_option_a,Further investigate the exchange between the men.
event_city_campaign_22_option_b,Leave the criminal element alone and continue enjoying the show. 
event_city_campaign_22_result_a,"You subtly move in the direction of the men, monitoring their actions with your peripheral vision. You recognize the dark robes from the run-ins you have had with cultists in the area, and as you get closer, you become convinced that the vials being traded contain blood. You grab the men and cause a huge amount of commotion as you fight to drag them outside and foil their dealings. You are able to hand them off to the proper authorities, but it may be a while before you are allowed back in the Brown Door. The concert was ruined."
event_city_campaign_22_result_b,The music is too good to be interrupted. You ignore the men in the back and simply have a great time.
event_city_campaign_23_intro,"You are walking home late at night when you hear some suspicious sounds coming from a nearby garden.

You move to investigate, and a shadowy figure bolts in the opposite direct carrying an armful of vegetables."
event_city_campaign_23_option_a,Give chase. Thieves must be brought to justice.
event_city_campaign_23_option_b,The thief had the right idea. Grab some vegetables for yourself.
event_city_campaign_23_result_a,"The figure overburdened with vegetables is no match for your speed. You quickly run him down and deliver him to the city guard. Thankfully very little of the produce was damaged in the pursuit, and you are able to return it to the owner of the garden."
event_city_campaign_23_result_b,"In an area cut off from civilization with no viable farmland, fresh vegetables are a rare commodity. The thief already made off with an armful, so what’s the harm in taking some more? When you get back to your room, you cook up a nice hearty soup and have a great meal."
event_city_campaign_24_intro,"Upon returning to the city after your latest adventure, you are approached by a high-ranking guard at the gate.

“Ah, good, I’m glad to have caught you,” the guard begins. “The capital has fallen behind on shipments of wood to Gloomhaven, so now it falls to us to pick up the slack so that construction of important city buildings doesn’t stagnate.”

The guard points to the east. “We’re forming an expedition to gather logs from the Corpsewood. We could use your help, either to guard against enemies or to chop down trees.”"
event_city_campaign_24_option_a,Join the expedition as a guard. 
event_city_campaign_24_option_b,Join the expedition as a logger. 
event_city_campaign_24_result_a,"The logging expedition heads to the outskirts of the Corpsewood and begins felling trees and transporting them back to Gloomhaven. You stay on your guard, patrolling the area and making sure there are no surprise attacks. A couple hours in, a tribe of Vermlings appear through the woods, but you are alert and prepared, dispatching them without a single casualty. The rest of the day goes by uneventfully."
event_city_campaign_24_result_b,"You journey out to the Corpsewood, axe in hand, and begin chopping away at the trees. You seem to have a natural skill with it, probably due to all the practice you get swinging a blade. Thanks to your help, the city is able to gather a large amount of extra wood for construction. You encounter some dangers throughout the day, but nothing you cannot handle."
event_city_campaign_25_intro,"On a trip to the Coin District, you catch sight of an old, wiry
Valrath carrying a large, intricate vase out his front door.
As you get closer, the Valrath begins to struggle with the vase, sweat pouring from his brow. Under the strain, the Valrath loses his balance, and the fragile vase topples downward as he yells a string of curses."
event_city_campaign_25_option_a,Attempt to catch the vase. 
event_city_campaign_25_option_b,"With no time to react, watch the vase fall to the ground. "
event_city_campaign_25_result_a_a,"You race forward and wrap your arms around the vase. You manage to keep grip of it, preventing tragedy. The Valrath is relieved and offers to pay you for your trouble if you carry it the rest of the way."
event_city_campaign_25_result_a_b,"You race forward and attempt to catch the vase, but it is too much for you. Your grip loosens and the vase shatters into a hundred pieces. The Valrath is irate, demanding compensation from you for breaking it. You pay him what you can."
event_city_campaign_25_result_b,"You watch helplessly as the vase careens out of the Valrath’s grasp and, once it connects with the hard ground, shatters
into a hundred pieces. The Valrath looks distraught and a little angry. You exchange a sympathetic glance with him and then
continue about your business."
event_city_campaign_26_intro,"While enjoying your customary post-adventure drink at the Sleeping Lion, you notice something weird going on with the lamps in the bar.

Your first thought is that it is your imagination, but after staring at the lamps intently, you see they are flickering in and out. Tech lamps, as opposed to normal gas-burning ones, have been known to be a bit unreliable.

As if on cue, the lamps suddenly go out completely, leaving the room pitch-black."
event_city_campaign_26_option_a,Offer to fix the lamps. It shouldn't be too hard with a bit of technical know-how. 
event_city_campaign_26_option_b,Take the opportunity to steal some valuables from drunk patrons in the dark. 
event_city_campaign_26_result_a_a,You quickly identify the source of the problem—some frayed wiring in the kitchen—and have it replaced in no time. The proprietor seems very impressed by your work and gives free drinks all around in your name.
event_city_campaign_26_result_a_b,You fumble about magnanimously for a while before concluding that you have no idea what you’re doing. The proprietor looks disappointed and sends out for a real tinkerer.
event_city_campaign_26_result_b_a,"The darkness gives the less scrupulous among you a good chance to perform their craft. Within a matter of minutes, your coin purses are much heavier."
event_city_campaign_26_result_b_b,"You attempt to lighten some purses, but even in the dark, you find the task a little outside your skill set. One patron catches your hand as it searches his belt. He starts yelling, and you flee as quickly as possible."
event_city_campaign_27_intro,"You are out in the Ward of Scales when you see a crowd of
people forming to the south, growing louder and more dense by the second.

As you approach, you see through the angry mob a terrified Vermling being pulled in your direction by a group of gruff men.

“Dirty thief!” a woman next to you screams. “String it up!”

Glancing behind you to where the crowd appears to be headed, you see a disused gibbet in the market square.

The men—clearly not guards—move closer."
event_city_campaign_27_option_a,Attempt to stop the crowd from hanging the Vermling. 
event_city_campaign_27_option_b,Take no action and see this through to its logical conclusion. 
event_city_campaign_27_result_a_a,"You keep a calm demeanor as you try to talk down the mob. It takes some effort, but the men finally agree to turn the thief over to the authorities, which stops the situation from devolving into chaos."
event_city_campaign_27_result_a_b,"You kindly entreat the crowd to back down, and when that doesn’t work, you resort to force. No one seems happy that you stopped the hanging, but it was the right thing to do."
event_city_campaign_27_result_b,"You watch as the men move past you toward the gibbet. One carries a thick rope that he ties around the Vermling’s neck. The other end of the rope is thrown over the cross beam and then the men begin pulling, hoisting the helpless thief up off his feet. He struggles in vain, a panicked look in his eyes, but eventually he stops moving. The men tie off the rope, leaving the lifeless thief hanging. People begin to mill about, many stopping to spit on the ground before returning to work."
event_city_campaign_28_intro,"Ah, the Sleeping Lion. Surely there is no better place to get a drink and relax after clearing out some dank dungeon.

On this particular occasion, though, you are approached by a heavily scarred Inox. She sits at your table and pushes forward a piece of paper.

“An interested party would like to hire you to steal a valuable figurine from a residence in the Battlements,” she says matter-of-factly. “The details are on the paper. Meet me in the back
alley in two days’ time after the job is done.”"
event_city_campaign_28_option_a,Accept the mysterious job. You can handle anything. 
event_city_campaign_28_option_b,Incredulously explain she must have the wrong people and you won't take the job. 
event_city_campaign_28_result_a_a,"The job proves easy enough with the proper expertise. The plans are simple, and you are in and out of the estate easily, free to meet up with the Inox and claim your payment."
event_city_campaign_28_result_a_b,"It turns out confidence isn’t enough when it comes to sneaking in and out of a well-guarded estate without being seen. You didn’t get the figurine, and one of the guards got a pretty good look at you."
event_city_campaign_28_result_b,You grab the Inox’s arm as she is getting up to leave and push the paper back toward her. She looks incredibly angry as you explain that your group doesn’t do this sort of thing. She wordlessly grabs the plans and storms out of the bar.
event_city_campaign_29_intro,"You get word from a contact that there is trouble brewing down at the East Walls and decide to investigate.

What you find is a large contingency of the city’s Savvas workforce—the best builders you’ll find anywhere—in open rebellion against the construction managers, demanding better pay for the specialized work they perform.

“This city would be a lifeless pile of rocks without us!” one of the Savvas yells. “It’s time we see some of its prosperity!”

The manager on the other side of the argument looks like a captured mouse, not sure at all how to get out of the situation."
event_city_campaign_29_option_a,"Talk to the Savvas, appealing to their sense of duty and community."
event_city_campaign_29_option_b,Talk to the managers and attempt to get the Savvas better pay.
event_city_campaign_29_result_a_a,"The workers’ hard expressions soften a bit when they see a Savvas among you. You talk for a while and explain that they need the city just as much as the city needs them. In the end, you sell them on a smaller wage increase, and everyone returns to work."
event_city_campaign_29_result_a_b,"Even after much effort, the workers won’t speak to you at all, calling you part of the problem. The strike is eventually resolved, but no one seems happy."
event_city_campaign_29_result_b_a,"“I-I just can’t give them more money!” the manager pleads. After some persuasion, though, he seems to open up to negotiation. The workers and management meet halfway and everyone seems content."
event_city_campaign_29_result_b_b,"You just can’t get the manager to budge on his position, and he only gets angrier with continued pushing. The Savvas eventually agree tentatively to continue work, but the underlying problem remains."
event_city_campaign_2_intro,"As the daylight fades, you find yourselves wandering through a
half-crowded market street, browsing wares.

“Hey! Over here!” You turn in the direction of the voice to see a filthy Vermling gesturing from a dark alley. “Yeah, you grim-looking chaps. I have something you might be interested in.”

The Vermling holds out a piece of metal covered in sludge. “Found this in the sewer. Writing on it I don’t understand, but I know it’s valuable. You can have it for ten gold!”"
event_city_campaign_2_option_a,Pay for the thing. You never know. 
event_city_campaign_2_option_b,Refuse to pay. Never trust a Vermling. 
event_city_campaign_2_result_a_a,You hand over the gold and take hold of the piece of garbage. Amidst troubling brown smears you see a lot of meaningless scratches likely made by rats and bugs. Oh well. Sometimes the long shot doesn’t pay off.
event_city_campaign_2_result_a_b,“Bah! You don’t have enough. Come back when you do!”
event_city_campaign_2_result_b,You laugh and gesture the Vermling away. You can recognize a low-life swindler when you see one. And that piece of garbage was just...foul.
event_city_campaign_30_intro,"As you shop for supplies at the Sinking Market, your hand instinctively goes for the purse at your waist.

It’s gone!

You quickly scan the crowd and see a small Vermling darting away from you, heading directly toward a sewer grating."
event_city_campaign_30_option_a,Give chase! No one steals from you and gets away with it.
event_city_campaign_30_option_b,Take a clear shot at him with a bow before he disappears into the grating.
event_city_campaign_30_result_a_a,"The Vermling escapes into the sewers, but the Mindthief is able to give chase, catching up as the cutpurse enters his nest.
There you find more wealth than what was lost."
event_city_campaign_30_result_a_b,"The Vermling disappears into the sewers, and you try to give chase. But after a few minutes you are hopelessly lost and are forced to give up."
event_city_campaign_30_result_b,"You raise your bow and take aim at the thief. A woman screams, but you try not to let it faze you. As the Vermling pauses to open the grate, you fire the arrow and see the furry
figure drop. You smile and go to retrieve your gold from the corpse. You get a lot of dirty looks, though. Apparently firing a bow on a crowded street is frowned upon."
event_city_campaign_31_intro,"You find yourself incredibly drunk and gambling away your hard-earned gold at the Brown Door when a robed woman approaches you.

“Please,” she says. “You must help me. They’ve taken my only daughter. I beg you!”

She slides a parchment toward you. “They left this behind...”

You look down to see nothing but the symbol of an upside-down black bird.

“The Ravens!” a man mutters. “Bad business.”

A bouncer approaches. “Take that garbage outside. You’re troubling the customers.”"
event_city_campaign_31_option_a,Leave with the woman to help her find her missing daughter.
event_city_campaign_31_option_b,Refuse to help the woman and go back to gambling.
event_city_campaign_31_result_a,"Once outside, the woman hands you a large
pouch of gold. “My father saw the whole
thing, but then he went mad and ran toward
the Silent Bridge. Please find him and he’ll
help you find my daughter!”"
event_city_campaign_31_result_b_a,"You try to turn away the woman and get back to gambling, but the Sunkeeper won’t hear of it. She forces you to follow the woman outside."
event_city_campaign_31_result_b_b,"You return to your gambling, but you feel as though a pall has fallen over the revelry. Your luck has turned, and you end the night much poorer than when you started."
event_city_campaign_32_intro,"As you return to town after your latest adventure, a highranking
guard approaches and gestures you to the side of the road.

“I am embarrassed to admit this,” he begins in a low voice, “but we could really use some help. With all the attacks recently and very little support from the capital, the city guard finds itself woefully lacking in both equipment and training for the new recruits.”

The guard looks you over. “You are experienced warriors, and anything you could do to help the situation would be greatly appreciated.”"
event_city_campaign_32_option_a,Agree to help the city guard. 
event_city_campaign_32_option_b,Decline to help and instead sell this information on to interested parties. 
event_city_campaign_32_result_a_a,"You not only help to train the new recruits, but the Quartermaster is able to repair a lot of the guards’ damaged armor and weaponry. At the end of the day, the city is very pleased with your contribution."
event_city_campaign_32_result_a_b,"You spend the day training the new recruits. By the time the sun goes down, their skills are much improved, and they are grateful to you because of it."
event_city_campaign_32_result_b,"Whenever there is bad news, there is always someone who delights in it and profits from it. Who would be happy to hear the city guards are having trouble? Thieves. And they pay surprisingly well for the information."
event_city_campaign_33_intro,"The Void is a troubling area in Gloomhaven—a vast, barren expanse of black sand amid the bustling streets of the city. No one enters its perimeter.

On a trip to the University, however, you see a young girl playing near the edge of the Void. Before you can warn her, she trips and falls onto the sand. She immediately emits a blood-curdling scream and begins to tear at her skin."
event_city_campaign_33_option_a,Run to the girl and attempt to pull her out of the Void.
event_city_campaign_33_option_b,Watch what happens with morbid curiosity.
event_city_campaign_33_result_a_a,"You grab the child and lift her clear of the haunting area. She is still screaming madly when the Aesther in your group lays a hand upon the child in deep concentration. Slowly, the crying subsides, and the child gets up and runs off."
event_city_campaign_33_result_a_b,"You get the child off the sand as quickly as you can, but it doesn’t do much good. The girl screams and screams no matter what aid is administered."
event_city_campaign_33_result_b,"Unable to resist, you watch to see what will happen to the girl. Her skin turns ashen and begins to flake away. She stops screaming eventually and begins coughing up a black bile. She tries to stand, but her legs crumble away into dust. She makes a pitiful croak and then falls over into a cloud of sand. When the cloud settles, no evidence of her presence remains."
event_city_campaign_34_intro,"After a night of revelry at the Sleeping Lion, you head out into the streets and notice a suspicious man in black robes skulking toward an alleyway.

You’ve been hearing reports about a cult inside the city, calling themselves the Ravens and performing all sort of terrible acts. Perhaps this is one of them."
event_city_campaign_34_option_a,Follow the man in an attempt to discover the Ravens' lair.
event_city_campaign_34_option_b,Confrot him on the spot and turn him over to the authorities. 
event_city_campaign_34_result_a_a,"Using the night like a cloak, you follow the man unseen and unheard. Eventually he stops at a small dwelling nestled under the west wall of the city."
event_city_campaign_34_result_a_b,"You sneak forward, confident in your stealth abilities. After a few minutes, though, the man suddenly bolts around a
corner. By the time you get there, he is long gone."
event_city_campaign_34_result_b,"Not confident in your stealth abilities, you decide speed and force are a better way to go. You charge forward, catching the man completely by surprise. You block off all avenues of escape and surround him. He snarls as you tie him up and hand him over to the city guards. Hopefully they’ll be able to get some useful information out of him."
event_city_campaign_35_intro,"Harrowers are a rare sight, both outside of Gloomhaven and
within. Which explains why you are bit surprised when you find yourself standing before three Harrowers in ornate robes unlike any you’ve ever seen.

“We require spices from across the sea,” one chitters at you. “Can you direct us to the appropriate merchant?”

A bit caught off guard, you ask about the specific kind of spice, but the Harrower makes only unintelligible hisses.

“It is hard to describe. We will know it when we see it. It is very important to our hive.”"
event_city_campaign_35_option_a,Point the way to the Sinking Market—the only place that would deal with them.
event_city_campaign_35_option_b,Escort the Harrowers to the New Market and help them find a spice merchant.
event_city_campaign_35_result_a,"You quickly point in the direction of the Sinking Market, assuring the Harrowers they will find exactly what they need there. They chitter and hand you a gold piece, then move on their way."
event_city_campaign_35_result_b_a,"You make your way to the market with the Harrowers in tow. It’s easy to find a reputable spice merchant, but difficult to get the merchant and the Harrowers to trust each other. In the end, they find common ground through the Plagueherald and make a deal."
event_city_campaign_35_result_b_b,"You bring the Harrowers to the market, but even after great effort, you cannot find any merchants willing to deal with them. They depart empty-handed."
event_city_campaign_36_intro,"You decide to unwind at the Sleeping Lion, but just as you
are starting to relax, a bear of a man crashes into your table, scattering your drinks across the floor.

Towering over him is a massive Inox. “What did you say about my horns?” the Inox shouts. The man stands up and brushes shards of glass from his tunic. “I said the sight of them makes me want to vomit!”

The Inox roars and charges headlong into the man, crashing through more tables in the process. At this, the entire tavern erupts into violence. After all, when a man is deep into his drink, the last thing you want to do is knock that drink over."
event_city_campaign_36_option_a,Join the fray! These insults will not go unanswered!
event_city_campaign_36_option_b,Do your best to stop the fighting. This is a respectable establishment.
event_city_campaign_36_result_a_a,"You break a chair over the man’s back, kick him in the teeth, and then you really get into it. It’s a bar brawl that could only be described as “epic,” fueled by pure, raw rage. The carnage is extreme."
event_city_campaign_36_result_a_b,"You jump into the melee, breaking heads and chairs in equal measure. You’ve seen worse brawls, but the proprietor still isn’t very happy when it’s over."
event_city_campaign_36_result_b_a,"You get up to calm down the room, but the Berserker has other ideas, laying into the man before you can get a word out. She goes into a furious rage, and there’s really not much to be done about it except pay what you can for the damages afterward."
event_city_campaign_36_result_b_b,"It takes some work, but you manage to calm down the Inox and buy off the rest of the room with some extra drinks. The proprietor looks positively relieved."
event_city_campaign_37_intro,"As you return to town after your latest adventure, you see
smoke rising from the walls of the city. You enter the broken gates and see a scene of despair as the citizens of Gloomhaven recover from a catastrophic attack.

“Demons,” a wounded guard at the gate says. “Wish you lot could have been around to help fight them off. Now look at the place. Luckily the rest of the city remained safe.”"
event_city_campaign_37_option_a,Attempt to console and cheer up those affected by the attack.
event_city_campaign_37_option_b,Help repair the gate. You wouldn’t want another attack to further cripple the town.
event_city_campaign_37_result_a_a,"The citizens are downtrodden, but the uncanny power of the Soothsinger’s music seems to lift their spirits considerably. Still far from cheerful, the people find new resolve in repairing the damage and rebuilding."
event_city_campaign_37_result_a_b,"The citizens view you with a cynical eye as you walk around, attempting to encourage them and lift their spirits. Despite the effort, it seems as though they are in a worse mood than when you arrived."
event_city_campaign_37_result_b_a,"You set to work repairing the gate, and by the time night falls,
it is at least functional. The downtrodden citizens are inspired by your work, and you have little doubt that the community will bounce back with little permanent damage."
event_city_campaign_37_result_b_b,You fiddle with the gate for a bit until it becomes clear that you are doing nothing to help. You decide to head back to your rooms instead and get some rest.
event_city_campaign_38_intro,"Walking through the crowded streets of the Ward of Scales, you suddenly hear a commotion behind you. You turn to see a gruff shirtless man badgering a male Orchid.

“I assure you, I did nothing of the sort,” the Orchid says calmly.

“You calling me a liar now?” bellows the man. “I think somebody needs to teach you a lesson.” The man careens forward with his fist and knocks the Orchid to the ground.

A gasp emerges from the crowd, but very quickly the attitude turns to excitement and encouragement. Nothing like a good fight to get a crowd worked up."
event_city_campaign_38_option_a,Intervene on the Orchid’s behalf.
event_city_campaign_38_option_b,Watch the fight with the crowd.
event_city_campaign_38_result_a_a,"The Orchid on the ground puts up no defense, but your group is a different matter. The man quickly backs down at the sight of a powerful Orchid ready to attack, and the crowd disperses, muttering disappointment."
event_city_campaign_38_result_a_b,"You try to talk some sense into the man, and when that doesn’t work, you beat him senseless. The crowd seems happy and the Orchid thanks you for your aid."
event_city_campaign_38_result_b_a,"After a good beating, the crowd is riled up. Many people start looking in your direction, muttering about how you have the nerve to associate with Orchids as well. You make a quick exit."
event_city_campaign_38_result_b_b,"The Orchid puts up no defense and the “fight” becomes rather one-sided. A solid beating is administered, and the crowd
is sated. You go about your business while the Orchid bleeds on the ground."
event_city_campaign_39_intro,"You are awakened in your room by a decisive knock at the door. You answer it to find a man in the robes of
the Great Oak.

“Greetings,” the man begins. “Our sanctuary is having a bit of trouble, and I’ve been directed to you as persons who could possibly help.

“You see, some of our relics have gone missing, and we suspect the worst. We are hoping you might grace us with your assistance in investigating this matter.”"
event_city_campaign_39_option_a,Agree to help the priest and accompany him to the sanctuary.
event_city_campaign_39_option_b,"Refuse to help, making some excuse about being too busy."
event_city_campaign_39_result_a,"The pious man seems incredibly happy you’ve decided to help the sanctuary. When you arrive at the great building, he explains in detail all that has happened. Using that
information, you inquire around town, putting out feelers to possible fences for the goods."
event_city_campaign_39_result_b,"You mutter something about hunting drakes and close the door on the priest. He becomes rather distraught as the door slams shut in his face, but surely he’ll get over it. You’ve got much more important things to do anyway."
event_city_campaign_3_intro,"As the daylight fades, you find yourselves wandering through a
half-crowded market street, browsing wares.

“Hey! Over here!” You turn in the direction of the voice to see a filthy Vermling gesturing from a dark alley. “Yeah, you grim-looking chaps. I have something you might be interested in.”

The Vermling holds out a piece of metal covered in sludge. “Found this in the sewer. Writing on it I don’t understand, but I know it’s valuable. You can have it for ten gold!”"
event_city_campaign_3_option_a,Pay for the thing. You never know. 
event_city_campaign_3_option_b,Refuse to pay. Never trust a Vermling. 
event_city_campaign_3_result_a_a,"You hand over the gold and take hold of the metal. You wipe
off the grime and slop to discover a foreign contraption made of large gears and many moving parts. If you can figure out what it is, this device might actually be of some worth."
event_city_campaign_3_result_a_b,“Bah! You don’t have enough. Come back when you do!”
event_city_campaign_3_result_b,You laugh and gesture the Vermling away. You can recognize a low-life swindler when you see one. And that piece of garbage was just...foul.
event_city_campaign_40_intro,"You are shopping for supplies in the Boiler’s District when an
intense explosion knocks you off your feet.

You look in the direction of the heat waves to see plumes of fire and smoke rising from a building less than a block a way.

The fire rages uncontrollably and there are many wounded residents laying near the blast, screaming in pain.

You also spot something else—a hooded figure
in a dark robe fleeing from the scene."
event_city_campaign_40_option_a,Rush to the aid of the residents and help put out the fire.
event_city_campaign_40_option_b,Pursue the hooded figure and make him answer for this attack.
event_city_campaign_40_result_a_a,"Some of your group immediately begin to tend to the wounded, bandaging cuts and administering potions."
event_city_campaign_40_result_a_b,"Some of your group beginto control the fire and snuff it with their elemental prowess, preventing further damage."
event_city_campaign_40_result_a_c,"You do your best, but without
the proper skills, it isn’t much."
event_city_campaign_40_result_b,"You jump to your feet and sprint as fast as you can in pursuit. The figure races toward the city wall and begins to climb the stairs. You close the gap, but look on in frustration as he moves to jump over the wall and out of the city. You lunge and grab his robe as he falls. His body twists awkwardly, freeing him of the robe. You look over the edge to see him land face-first on the ground and not get up."
event_city_campaign_41_intro,"The Sinking Market is a varied area of decrepit huts and
merchants unable to sell their wares anywhere else. It doesn’t surprise you as you walk through to see a scraggly Vermling
approach with a small sack.

“A potion for the big, strong adventurers!” she says as she waves you down. “Help you in battle, it will!”

You are about to push her aside and keep walking when she pulls the potion out of the sack. It glows green in the daylight—an impressive, large flask of master craftsmanship.

“Aha, I knew it catch your eye! How much you pay?”"
event_city_campaign_41_option_a,Barter with the Vermling for the potion.
event_city_campaign_41_option_b,Move along. You don’t need any more potions.
event_city_campaign_41_result_a_a,"The Vermling knows it is valuable, but she is more interested in flirting with the Beast Tyrant. She is happy to sell the potion at a discount."
event_city_campaign_41_result_a_b,No amount of haggling can lower the Vermling’s high price.
event_city_campaign_41_result_a_c,The Vermling will not accept the tiny sum you offer. Maybe next time.
event_city_campaign_41_result_b,"Shaking your head, you move past the Vermling and get back to your business. She begins to make sobbing sounds behind you.
“But, but you die without potion! Is life worth
nothing?”"
event_city_campaign_42_intro,"Walking near the West Gate, you are approached by a scrawny kid in a guard uniform, which is clearly
too big for his small frame.

“Hey, you all are famous!” he says with a big smile. “I worked as a caravan guard before I got this job. Met with a big Inox guy who always talked about you. He made you seem like the nicest, most amazing people.”

His smile and excitement doesn’t waver. “Say, my detail is doing some work to repair the wall damage from the last Vermling attack. Would you mind helping us? It’ll be fun!”"
event_city_campaign_42_option_a,Agree to help the presumptuous kid.
event_city_campaign_42_option_b,Tell this kid that he must have the wrong group of adventurers.
event_city_campaign_42_result_a,"It’s hard work, but the kid’s enthusiasm is infectious. He wants to know all about your exploits and adventures, and he and his detail prove to be a great audience. By the end of the day, it hardly feels like you’ve worked at all."
event_city_campaign_42_result_b,You shake your head and avert your gaze. You claim that the kid must have you confused with a different adventuring party. He looks crushed as you walk away.
event_city_campaign_43_intro,"You return to your rooms for the evening to find a small note
resting on the ground in front of your door.

It is from the Tinkerer, explaining that he has been pursuing further studies in flammable liquid delivery methods. He asks for your help in delivering to him a small robotic contraption that he absentmindedly left behind in a secret stash under the floorboards of his old room.

He details the device’s location and gives an address to deliver it to—some small village far to the northwest."
event_city_campaign_43_option_a,Oblige the Tinkerer and send along the contraption.
event_city_campaign_43_option_b,You don’t want to pay for postage. Just keep the thing for yourself.
event_city_campaign_43_result_a_a,"Sure enough, under the floorboards of his old room, you find a bunch of parts, tools, and an intricately crafted metal spider. You package it up and ship it off to the Tinkerer. Anything for an old friend."
event_city_campaign_43_result_a_b,"You don’t have the money to send him the contraption, so you decide just to keep it for yourself."
event_city_campaign_43_result_b,"Like an eager treasure hunter, you pry up the floorboards in the Tinkerer’s old room and find a trove of useless junk, plus a detailed robotic spider that is anything but useless. You switch it on and let it scurry around the room. This could be a significant help in battle. No way it’s getting shipped off."
event_city_campaign_44_intro,"In the very early morning, you are wakened by a knock at your
door. Standing behind it is giant, dirty Inox wearing a leather apron.

“Oh, uh...ahem,” he coughs. “Sorry, I was looking for a female Orchid. She used to help me on occasion with my forge. Her control over fire was astounding and I paid her well for her assistance completing some of my specialty work.”

He scratches his head. “I guess she’s not around anymore. You wouldn’t happen to know where I could find someone who could help me in her absence, would you?”"
event_city_campaign_44_option_a,Offer to help the blacksmith yourself.
event_city_campaign_44_option_b,Direct him to the Savvas Elemental Guild and go back to sleep.
event_city_campaign_44_result_a_a,"Despite the early hour, you head down to the Inox’s forge and get an incredibly strong fire going for him so he can complete his order. He seems very pleased."
event_city_campaign_44_result_a_b,The Inox is completely dumbfounded when you walk all the way down to his forge and then proceed to exhibit zero aptitude at manipulating or controlling fire.
event_city_campaign_44_result_b,"“Ah, yes, that is probably a good idea,” he says. “Thanks for your time and I hope your friend the Spellweaver is doing well!”"
event_city_campaign_45_intro,"“You there! Stop!”

You turn to see a city guard walking briskly toward you.

“You are known associates of this woman, yes?” He holds up a crude sketch of the Scoundrel. “We believe she is behind a number of high-profile robberies and demand that you give us any information you have on her whereabouts and activities.”

His face softens a bit. “Look, I know you guys do a lot of good for the city, but the merchant guild is breathing down my neck on this one, and I could really use a lead.”"
event_city_campaign_45_option_a,Cooperate with the guard and tell him everything you know.
event_city_campaign_45_option_b,"Be as vague and unhelpful as possible, giving no useful information."
event_city_campaign_45_result_a,"The guard taps his notes with a smile on his
face.

“This is great,” he says. “I understand that you haven’t seen her in a while, but the information you’ve provided should still be useful. Have a nice day!”"
event_city_campaign_45_result_b,"The guard scratches his head and looks down
at his notes.

“Well, that wasn’t very helpful,” he sighs. “But thanks for your time, I guess. Let me know if you remember anything or get any new information.”"
event_city_campaign_46_intro,"Anticipating an enjoyable night of drinks at the Sleeping Lion, you enter the tavern to see a familiar Savvas sitting at your usual table. The Cragheart stands and extends both its arms.

“Ah, friends! So good to see you,” it says. “Sit! Have a drink with me!”"
event_city_campaign_46_option_a,Have a drink with the Cragheart. 
event_city_campaign_46_option_b,Encourage the Cragheart to move on with its life.
event_city_campaign_46_result_a,"One drink turns into five, and five turns into even more. It is a great night of revelry at the Sleeping Lion. You see sadness in the Cragheart’s eyes when you finally stand up to leave. It tells you it’s been hard to find people to relate to since leaving the party and it thanks you for your continued friendship."
event_city_campaign_46_result_b,"Not fitting in with its own kind or with a city of mostly humans, the Cragheart thought it could depend on a misfit group of
mercenaries for friendship. It understands that its adventuring life is now in the past, though, and that it should go find a new place to belong. It sadly admits that it has no idea where that would be, but the Cragheart gets up and leaves the tavern nonetheless."
event_city_campaign_47_intro,"Walking near Gloomhaven Square, you see a peculiar scene.
A group of guards is dragging along a Vermling in tattered robes toward the Ghost Fortress. Getting a little closer, you
recognize the Mindthief.

“Hssss,” she spits. “Why do you do this? I came to you! I tell you that this town is being poisoned, and you respond by imprisoning me?”

“We’ll see what the Captain of the Guard has to say about this,” one of her captors says. “Keep moving!”"
event_city_campaign_47_option_a,Intervene with the guards and find out what is going on.
event_city_campaign_47_option_b,Let the guards continue their business and just continue with yours.
event_city_campaign_47_result_a,"The guards look incredibly perturbed when you step in front of them and ask that they leave the Mindthief to you. After some effort, they begrudgingly hand her over. The Mindthief thanks you, explaining that her colony in the sewers is being poisoned, and the poison is quickly migrating to the city’s water supply. She says she’s tracked the source to a small cove along the Hook Coast."
event_city_campaign_47_result_b,"The Mindthief flicks her tail and throws insults around, but it doesn’t seem to have any positive effect. She is led away and out of view. You get about your business, hoping that bit about the town being poisoned wasn’t too serious."
event_city_campaign_48_intro,"You are haggling over the price of road rations with an irritating
Valrath merchant when a messenger boy approaches you holding a note.

“Sir, I have a pressing letter from an important Valrath Sunkeeper,” the messenger says. “I was told to deliver it to you.”

You reach for it, but the messenger moves back a little. “Sir, this note has traveled a long distance to get to you. If you could, please pay a small fee to take possession of it.”"
event_city_campaign_48_option_a,Begrudgingly pay for the note.
event_city_campaign_48_option_b,Refuse to pay for the note.
event_city_campaign_48_result_a_a,You throw the kid a few coins and grab the note. Enclosed with the note is a small medallion engraved with the image of the sun. Apparently the Sunkeeper thinks the object may help you at some point in the future. The note doesn’t say exactly how and the thing has no apparent use. You stow it away in your pack.
event_city_campaign_48_result_a_b,"You reach into your pocket to pay the kid, but come up empty-handed. He slinks off in indignation."
event_city_campaign_48_result_b,"You laugh in indignation and push the messenger away. He opens his mouth to object, then thinks better of it and runs off.
You turn back to bartering, now leveraging the proof of your extreme thriftiness against the merchant."
event_city_campaign_49_intro,"“Your Quartermaster friend sent me.” You look quizzically at the Valrath standing at your door.

“I’m from the Capital, and I deal in arms and armor,” he says. “I’m looking to set up a contract with the Gloomhaven military, and our friend says that you may have some contacts with them. He suggested I meet up with you once I got here.”

The Valrath shifts his feet nervously. “So, can
you help me?”"
event_city_campaign_49_option_a,Agree to help him make contact with the military.
event_city_campaign_49_option_b,Demand a finder’s fee for setting him up with buyers.
event_city_campaign_49_result_a,"You take the Valrath over to the Ghost Fortress, where you make introductions to the Captain of the Guard. The Captain seems skeptical at first, but admits that they could use an additional supply of weapons. Terms are made, and a contract is signed."
event_city_campaign_49_result_b_a,"The Valrath looks at you with trepidation, but after some persuasion, you get him to agree."
event_city_campaign_49_result_b_b,"The Valrath recoils, insulted by the notion. He storms off, grumbling about the lost value of friendship."
event_city_campaign_4_intro,"Having recently returned from your latest adventure, you are
approached by a ratty-looking boy in tears.

“Please, sirs, could you please help me with my cat? He went over there, and I’m afraid.” The boy points a dirty finger at a decrepit, abandoned building. “I don’t know what else to do.”"
event_city_campaign_4_option_a,Find a cat? You have more important things to do. 
event_city_campaign_4_option_b,Reassure the boy and go find the cat. 
event_city_campaign_4_result_a,You shake your head and direct the boy to go find his mother. With any luck she will knock some sense into him so that he stops troubling strangers with such trivial matters.
event_city_campaign_4_result_b,"You approach the foreboding house full of heroic bravado. There’s certainly nothing otherworldly about the structure, but its fallen beams and piles of rubble do make it difficult to look around. By the time you find the cat hiding under a burned-out bed frame, you are utterly exhausted. At least the boy is ecstatic his cat has been found."
event_city_campaign_50_intro,"“A monstrous creature approaches the walls!” A guard with a truly terrified look runs toward you, waving his arms with manic energy. “Please! You must help!” Before you can even agree, he grabs you by the wrist and pulls you toward the East Gate.

You hear the beast before you see it, bellowing with rage and pounding at the gates. Each time it hits, the entire city shakes. You climb the ramparts and look down at the massive creature with six legs as thick as trees, two spiraling horns, and a spiked tail.

“This is truly a demon from the abyss,” the guard laments. It must be from another plane, so he’s not too far off."
event_city_campaign_50_option_a,"Attack the beast from the wall, shooting arrows at it until it stops moving."
event_city_campaign_50_option_b,Work on reinforcing the walls. Hold it off for as long as possible.
event_city_campaign_50_result_a,"You grab a bow and start sending arrows down into the thing’s thick hide. Each individual arrow doesn’t do much, but over time the creature slows. By the time it manages to break through the gate, it has been considerably hobbled as black blood pours from its countless wounds. It charges forward, laying waste to a small shop, but as more arrows continue to rain down upon it, it soon stops and falls over lifeless."
event_city_campaign_50_result_b,"You set to work reinforcing the gate with anything you can find—planks of wood, carts full of stones, your own bodies. Due to your tremendous effort, the guards on the walls manage to bring down the beast before it breaks through. The various merchants of the Boiler’s District thank you for your valiant service."
event_city_campaign_51_intro,"You are wandering through the city streets late at night when you hear a terrifying scream high above you. You look up just in time to see a body falling toward you and jump out of the way.

It lands with a wet thud on the ground. You were not the only ones to hear the scream, and quickly a small crowd forms around the corpse, including a couple of city guards.

The body is clad in black leather armor, and a long, thin blade conspicuously protrudes from its back. You remark that the sword somehow looks familiar.

“What?” asks a guard. “This is the third murder like this in a week. Tell me everything you know!”"
event_city_campaign_51_option_a,"Tell the guard that the sword belongs to the Nightshroud, your former party member."
event_city_campaign_51_option_b,Lie and claim you know nothing.
event_city_campaign_51_result_a,"You explain that you recognize the sword from the time you spent traveling with the Nightshroud. As a capable assassin, he is likely to be the one behind the murders. You explain, however, that since he left the group, you have no knowledge of his whereabouts or dealings. The guard thanks you for the information."
event_city_campaign_51_result_b_a,"You shake your head at the guard, saying you must have been mistaken. You thought the sword looked similar to one carried by a friend, but, looking closer, there are distinct differences. The guard shrugs and goes back to examining the scene."
event_city_campaign_51_result_b_b,You laugh and make up some poor explanation about seeing a similar sword on a bandit in a crypt. The guard eyes you suspiciously.
event_city_campaign_52_intro,"You have been hearing rumors in the bars: a pox is spreading
through Gloomhaven, affecting lower class citizens—street urchins and backalley thugs.

And then one night you see it: a Harrower dressed in a ragged green cloak holding a man down in an alley as its swarm spreads out and consumes him. The man’s screams are muffled as the insects skitter down his throat.

Killing monsters and demons is one thing, but the Plagueherald shouldn’t be preying on people in the city. You approach it, intent on stopping its attack."
event_city_campaign_52_option_a,"Calmly explain the situation to the Plagueherald, imploring it to move on."
event_city_campaign_52_option_b,Threaten the Plagueherald with retribution if it doesn’t stop attacking residents.
event_city_campaign_52_result_a,"With the man dead at its feet, the Plagueherald makes a chittering sound that sounds almost like laughing.

“You cannot see it, but this city needs to be cleansed. You will see, and you will thank me.”

At this, the Plagueherald bursts out into a massive swarm of insects and flies up into the sky.

The deaths continue, and new rumors start about how you are associated with the killer."
event_city_campaign_52_result_b,"The Plagueherald recoils at your threat, genuinely concerned that you would attack it.

“But, the cleansing...the city isn’t ready.”

You shake your head, and the Harrower chitters in disappointment.

“Very well, but you will be responsible when the Harbinger comes.” It turns and floats off into the darkness."
event_city_campaign_53_intro,"Walking near the northern gates, you see some commotion as a group of wounded guards is ushered into town.

They look pretty bad off, suffering from many
severe wounds. Some even have lost limbs.

Bringing up the rear, one guard is carried in by a couple of others. He’s missing a leg and has a vicious-looking axe embedded in his side. You realize that the axe looks kind of familiar."
event_city_campaign_53_option_a,Let the guards know you recognize the Berserker’s axe.
event_city_campaign_53_option_b,Stay silent and keep out of it.
event_city_campaign_53_result_a,"You approach the wounded detail, explaining how that axe belonged to a former member of your party.

“Yeah, we know,” one of them says with an icy stare. “Said we were desecrating her land or some such nonsense and just went crazy. But we weren’t doing anything but patrolling! Quite a piece of work your friend. Just take the axe if you want and get out of here.”"
event_city_campaign_53_result_b,"You casually move on, wondering how the guards found themselves on the wrong side of the Berserker’s rage. It probably wasn’t very difficult."
event_city_campaign_54_intro,"Posters spring up in town announcing the performance of a
master Quatryl musician and her merry band of performers. Looking closely at the image, you’re pretty sure you recognize that foppish feathered hat.

The poster says the next show is tonight. You decide to attend for one purpose or another."
event_city_campaign_54_option_a,Go to the show and cheer on the Soothsinger.
event_city_campaign_54_option_b,Seems like a good opportunity to pick some pockets while people are distracted.
event_city_campaign_54_result_a,You go and enjoy the Soothsinger’s concert immensely. There is even a song or two about your party and its adventures around Gloomhaven.
event_city_campaign_54_result_b_a,The rubes are much too distracted to mind their coin purses. You make off with a good amount of cash and get to listen to some nice music as well.
event_city_campaign_54_result_b_b,"You put forth a valiant effort, but, due to a lack of skill, you don’t make much headway parting people from their money. At least the music is good."
event_city_campaign_55_intro,"“Ah, they said I might find you here.” A portly Valrath woman
looks down at you as you are enjoying a cold beverage at the Sleeping Lion.

“A group of wild-looking Orchids came to the Temple of Coin today hoping to engage in trade with the merchants of the city. One particularly dour-looking one with a bow said you lot would vouch for them.

“We’re always wary of traps and betrayal out here on the edge of the wilds, but if you think these Orchids can be trusted, then the Merchant’s Guild may consider opening trade with them.”"
event_city_campaign_55_option_a,Vouch for the Orchids.
event_city_campaign_55_option_b,Advise against trading with the Orchids.
event_city_campaign_55_result_a,"“Well, we’ll take it under advisement. Personally, I don’t even know why your opinion matters, but some people in the Merchant’s Guild seem to like you.

“Anyway, feel free to get back to your life of
consumption and murder.”"
event_city_campaign_55_result_b,"The Valrath woman nods. “I agree. Orchids are not to be trusted. Personally, I thought you lacked the brains to make a proper decision, but I’m happy to be proven wrong.”"
event_city_campaign_56_intro,"Looking for a little bit of variety, you head down to the Brown Door as night falls. After some wait, you pass through the doors and are surprised to see the Sawbones sitting near the back of the room by himself. Considering this bar is about as seedy and corrupt as they come, it is just about the last place you would expect to find him.

“I just...I don’t know what to do now,” the Sawbones confesses after you sit down. “I’d like to join the sanctuary and lead a nice, quiet life, but after adventuring with all of you, that just
doesn’t seem fulfilling anymore.”

He shakes his head. “I don’t know. This life seems
so boring now. What do you think?”"
event_city_campaign_56_option_a,Tell him that joining the sanctuary is the right thing to do.
event_city_campaign_56_option_b,Tell him to follow his dreams.
event_city_campaign_56_result_a,"“I guess you’re right,” he shrugs. “Here’s to one last night of freedom.” He lifts his glass and gulps down the contents. You follow his lead and the rest is a blur."
event_city_campaign_56_result_b,"“You’re right! I’m in command of my own life, and I’m going to do what I want with it. Maybe I’ll go to the Capital and start my own business or something. Who knows?”

He lifts his glass and looks at you. “To endless possibilities! The next round’s on me.”"
event_city_campaign_57_intro,"You are haggling over the price of road rations with an irritating
Valrath merchant when a messenger boy approaches you holding a note.

“Sir, I have a pressing letter written by a powerful Savvas that has come to you from all the way across the Misty Sea,” the messenger says. “I was told to deliver it directly.”

You reach for it, but the messenger moves back a little. “Sir, this note has traveled a very long distance to get to you. If you could, please pay a small fee to take possession of it.”"
event_city_campaign_57_option_a,Pay for the note. 
event_city_campaign_57_option_b,Refuse to pay for the note. 
event_city_campaign_57_result_a_a,"You open the note to discover it is from the Elementalist, who has sailed to the eastern continent to gain a deeper understanding of the elements. During this time, the Elementalist also spent some effort on the construction of a powerful staff and wanted to share the design."
event_city_campaign_57_result_a_b,"You reach into your pocket to pay the kid, but come up empty-handed. He slinks off in indignation."
event_city_campaign_57_result_b,"You laugh in indignation and push the messenger away. He opens his mouth to object, then thinks better of it and runs off. You turn back to bartering, now leveraging the proof of your extreme thriftiness against the merchant."
event_city_campaign_58_intro,"“There were fifty of them, I swear. Tearing my mates apart!”

You look over to the bar where a group of drunkards are all laughing at a disheveled man in the middle of a story.

“And commanding them all, riding atop a giant armored bear, there was a Vermling with a staff that shot lightning!”

At this the crowd erupts into more laughter, drowning out the rest of the man’s story. “This man’s had too much to drink, I’d say,” ridicules one of the crowd. “Vermlings riding bears! I thought I’d heard of everything!”"
event_city_campaign_58_option_a,Join the crowd in laughing at the man. 
event_city_campaign_58_option_b,Calm down the crowd and get more details from the man about the attack. 
event_city_campaign_58_result_a,"You move closer and join in on the fun. After a while, the man gives up and resigns himself to his glass. But his story provides entertainment for weeks."
event_city_campaign_58_result_b,"It’s not easy, but you quiet down the crowd and take the staggering man over to a secluded corner of the tavern to get the full story out of him. Apparently he was part of a group of ruffians working to harvest the Dagger Forest for wood. In the middle of their logging expedition, however, they were attacked by the Beast Tyrant and an army of forest animals. Though he ran off in the middle of the fight, the man swears he also heard the howl of angry spirits in the chaos."
event_city_campaign_59_intro,"You head to the Sinking Market, hoping to find some cheap supplies, when you are surprised to see a crowd gathering in the distance. You push your way through and see a host of dead bodies in the street, covered in insects and strange pustules in their skin.

Nearby, a woman screams in terror and runs away. Other more curious onlookers inch closer, trying to get a better view of the grotesque scene."
event_city_campaign_59_option_a,Help to dispose of the corpses as quickly as possible. 
event_city_campaign_59_option_b,Investigate the corpses. 
event_city_campaign_59_result_a,"Finding it probable that these corpses harbor some sort of disease, you ward everyone away while you carefully load the bodies onto a cart, take them outside the city, and burn them.

The crowd is a little disappointed that you took away the morning entertainment. Especially annoyed are the guards, who don’t appreciate you disposing of dead bodies before they can investigate them."
event_city_campaign_59_result_b,"Curiosity gets the better of you, as well, and you approach the corpses with morbid fascination, hoping to find some clue about what happened. The number of insects is alarming, as is the diseased nature of the skin. If you had to guess, a Harrower could be responsible, or perhaps Xorn, who you so helpfully revived. Over the next few days, the disease spreads throughout the Sinking Market, killing many more people."
event_city_campaign_5_intro,"After resting for the evening, you start out your day noticing a
great number of prominent, commanding posters around the city.

Reading one, you learn that the Sanctuary of the Great Oak is laying down the foundation for a new building on the east side of Gloomhaven. Everyone is encouraged to come and help. This could be an important community event."
event_city_campaign_5_option_a,Go help lay the foundation.
event_city_campaign_5_option_b,Take the opportunity to steal some valuables in the area while people are distracted. 
event_city_campaign_5_result_a,"Amidst a great deal of revelry, you put all you have into laying the foundation of the sanctuary. Surely much good will be done
here healing the sick and wounded. After all your exhaustive efforts, though, you might end up being their first patients."
event_city_campaign_5_result_b,"You head to the prosperous east side of town, not to help lay down the foundation, but to steal some goods from shopkeepers too silly to lock up their wares during the festivities.
You make off with a good deal of money and
the distracted guards are none the wiser"
event_city_campaign_60_intro,"You are wandering the Ward of Scales in the evening when a crowd of people begins to form outside one of the shops, growing louder and more dense by the second.

As you approach, you see a terrified family of Quatryls through a familiar angry mob. The father pleads with a group of disheveled men with torches.

“Cheats!” A woman next to you screams. “Burn the store down!”

One of the men—clearly not a guard—backhands the father away from the door and pushes his way inside the shop."
event_city_campaign_60_option_a,Attempt to stop the men from burning down the shop.
event_city_campaign_60_option_b,Take part in the looting and burning of the store.
event_city_campaign_60_result_a_a,"You push your way to the front of the mob and stop the men as they enter the store. Clearly emotions have gotten the better of these people. Through a calm demeanor, you are able to talk the mob down. A sense of relief washes over the crowd."
event_city_campaign_60_result_a_b,"You kindly entreat the crowd to back down. It gets a little rough, but it becomes clear the crowd isn’t fully into it. After knocking a few heads, the mob disperses."
event_city_campaign_60_result_b,"You watch as one of the men picks up a wooden crate and throws it through the shop window. In a frenzy, the crowd rushes into the store, breaking and looting with mad glee. It’s easy enough to move in with the crowd and pick up a few valuable items in the chaos. After you get clear of the crowd, you look back to see billows of smoke rising up from the door and broken window. Not a good day to be a Quatryl."
event_city_campaign_61_intro,"The day proves uneventful until you head back to your room in the evening to find a small package waiting at your doorstep. Resting on it is another note from the Tinkerer.

He thanks you profusely for sending along the mechanical spider, saying it was a great help in his work. He doesn’t need it any longer, however, and decided to send it back.

He explains that he made a few improvements to it as well while it was in his possession, and that it should help you significantly in your adventures."
event_city_campaign_61_option_a,Gratefully keep the spider. 
event_city_campaign_61_option_b,"You can't decide who should keep it, so sell the spider and split the money. "
event_city_campaign_61_result_a,"You open the package to find a much larger but equally intricate robotic spider staring back at you. This one appears to specialize in scurrying around its user, picking up and returning anything that might have been dropped. Should prove useful."
event_city_campaign_61_result_b,"You head down to the Mixed District with the newly improved spider and barter with some Quatryls who seem incredibly impressed with the craftsmanship. After some back-and-forth, you walk away with a nice sum of gold coins."
event_city_campaign_62_intro,"“So, I hear you stood up for me with the city guards the other day. Such annoying pests, aren’t they?”

You turn around in the street to see the Scoundrel emerge from a dark alley with a smile on her face.

“I just wanted to thank you in person,” she says. “I’ve known quite a few persons who would have ratted me out for their chance at a piece of gold. It’s good to know some friendships last.”

She looks over her shoulder. “Listen, I’m leaving town for a good long while. You wanna grab a drink before I take off?”"
event_city_campaign_62_option_a,Have a drink and reminisce about old times.
event_city_campaign_62_option_b,Overpower the Scoundrel and deliver her to the city guards.
event_city_campaign_62_result_a,"You laugh for a while and trade tales. As the sun drops below the tavern windows, the Scoundrel gets up to leave.

“Listen, I really did enjoy our time together, and, well, I just wanted to leave you with something to remember me by.”

A piece of black cloth flutters down onto the table. When you look back up, the Scoundrel is gone."
event_city_campaign_62_result_b,"A look of horrid surprise flashes in the Scoundrel’s eyes as you leap forward and throw her to the ground. She doesn’t even speak as you bind her arms and take her to the city guard. They thank you for your service, but their words aren’t much counter to the cold, angry stare of the Scoundrel as she’s taken away."
event_city_campaign_63_intro,"“I assume you are aware of an increased amount of sickness in the city.”

You were summoned to the Ghost Fortress and now stand before the Captain of the Guard.

“We believe it could have something to do with a poisoning threat brought to our attention by your Mindthief friend a while ago. We ignored it, but now she is nowhere to be found, the Hook Coast is a bed of disease, and Gloomhaven proper is on its way there, too.”

He looks at you firmly. “I need you to head down to the Hook Coast and figure out what is going on. Then eliminate the source of the poison."""
event_city_campaign_63_option_a,Agree to help. 
event_city_campaign_63_option_b,Tell the captain to fix his own problem. 
event_city_campaign_63_result_a,"The Hook Coast is outside the walls of Gloomhaven and can be a dangerous place. And since this spread of poison, the city has become even more defenseless than normal. You hope you’ll be able to find a solution to the problem quickly."
event_city_campaign_63_result_b,"The Captain of the Guard sighs.

“I really thought you were the ones for the job. What business could you possibly have that is more important than making sure this city is safe?”

He holds up his hand. “No matter. Fine, just get out of here! We will deal with this ourselves.”"
event_city_campaign_64_intro,"Late in the evening, you are returning to your rooms when you hear a cry for help coming from a nearby alleyway. Racing into the shadows, you expect to find someone in distress, but instead find a group of men clad in black leather armor eying you maliciously.

“We have a message for your Nightshroud friend,” one of them says, drawing a wicked-looking curved blade. Suddenly, the Nightshroud appears among them in a flash of fatal sword
strikes. Before the men even have a chance to react, half of them lie dead on the ground. The other half quickly flee.

“Well, it looks like you’re into it now, too. Which is good, because I need help taking them down.”"
event_city_campaign_64_option_a,Stay and listen to what the Nightshroud has to say.
event_city_campaign_64_option_b,Claim you want nothing to do with this and walk away.
event_city_campaign_64_result_a,"The Nightshroud kicks one of the corpses. “This is the Sin-Ra Syndicate, a group of assassins trying to gain a foothold in the
region. I’m trying to stop them, and somehow they found out you and I were friends. They decided to go after you as retribution. Lucky for you, I’ve located their hideout, so we’re going to sneak in there and end this whole business once and for all.”"
event_city_campaign_64_result_b,"“The Sin-Ra Syndicate seems to think you have something to do with this,” the Nightshroud yells at you as you leave. “That’s
all that matters! They’ll strike again, and I won’t be there to protect you!” You keep walking."
event_city_campaign_65_intro,"In the middle of the night, you are wakened by a hard knocking at your door. You answer, and it takes you a second to recognize the man standing on
the other side.

“Those Oak relics you was lookin’ for,” the man says as he scratches a blister on the side of his face. “Some cutpurses tried to sell them to me. I can take you to their place, but we gotta move fast, and I want a cut of the loot.”

You hurriedly agree and make your way to a ramshackle warehouse next to the old docks.

“This is it,” the man says. “Looks like no one’s home, though.”"
event_city_campaign_65_option_a,Raid the warehouse and recover the stolen goods.
event_city_campaign_65_option_b,Wait until the thieves return so you can apprehend them.
event_city_campaign_65_result_a,"You head into the warehouse and search, eventually finding a hidden cache of stolen goods. The thieves, however, are nowhere to be found. You think about waiting for them to return, but it’s possible they have already been alerted to your presence. You return to the sanctuary, where the priest is pleased to have the artifacts returned, but troubled that the thieves are still out there."
event_city_campaign_65_result_b,"You hide behind some barrels and wait for the thieves to return. It takes the rest of the night, but just as you are about to give up, two men approach the door. It’s easy enough to get the drop on them, overpower them, and deliver them to the authorities. When you return the stolen artifacts to the sanctuary, the priest is incredibly pleased with your work."
event_city_campaign_66_intro,"You head back to your rooms for the night when you see the Sawbones sitting in front of your doorstep, looking rather dejected.

“I, uh, well, you see...” he stammers, “I followed your advice. Chased my dreams and all that, but I ended up in debt to some rather unscrupulous people. They’ve threatened to kill me if I don’t pay them off, but, uh, but I simply don’t have the money.”

He hesitates. “Seeing as how, uh, you bear some responsibility for setting me down this path, I was wondering if you’d be willing to offer some assistance in getting me out of this mess?”"
event_city_campaign_66_option_a,Offer to pay off the Sawbones’ debt.
event_city_campaign_66_option_b,Get the Sawbones on a boat across the Misty Sea. New adventures surely await there.
event_city_campaign_66_result_a,"It’s a hefty chunk of money, but the Sawbones is incredibly grateful.

“This is wonderful! I knew I could count on you. This should be enough to put this mess behind me and finally allow me to live free.”

He hands you a potion and thanks you once again for all your help."
event_city_campaign_66_result_b,"You flatly refuse to pay off the Sawbones’ debt and convince him the only way to escape his pursuers is to board a ship bound for the eastern continent, far out of their reach. He is reluctant, but eventually agrees when you remind him what unknown adventures await in the land across the ocean. You see him off in the night and desperately hope that is the last you hear of this situation."
event_city_campaign_67_intro,"You are trying to enjoy a relaxing drink at the Sleeping Lion
when a number of large men and Inox burst into the tavern and approach your table.

“So, you must be that little creep’s collateral,” one of the Inox says. “We’re here to collect.”

When you stare at her in silence, she tries again. “Little grey-bearded man. Wore symbols of the Great Oak. He said you lot would pay off his debt if he couldn’t.”

She pats an axe at her side. “Now, seeing as how he apparently skipped town, you can pay us, or things are gonna get ugly.”"
event_city_campaign_67_option_a,Pay off the thugs.
event_city_campaign_67_option_b,Refuse to pay. You won’t be strongarmed by anyone.
event_city_campaign_67_result_a_a,"You sigh and hand over the Sawbones’ debt, plus interest. Though it feels terrible, the thugs are satisfied and walk out the same way they came in. At least it is over now."
event_city_campaign_67_result_a_b,"Seeing as how you don’t have enough money, you decide pursue other options."
event_city_campaign_67_result_b,"You laugh and wave your hand dismissively. There’s no way you will be paying such a large amount of money to these thugs. Unfortunately, the Inox is not amused.

“Then your payment will be blood!” she says. “Meet us in the back alley, and we’ll see if we can’t come to terms.”"
event_city_campaign_68_intro,"You wake in the middle of the night to the sound of rushing water. In the corner of your room, you see a flood gushing out of the head of the Summoner’s staff, which you had previously picked up in your travels.

You jump out of bed and splash through a growing puddle of water to investigate the staff, but you can’t make any sense of it. It seems to be materializing the water out of thin air, possibly channeling it from another plane of existence. You scratch your head, unsure of what to do next."
event_city_campaign_68_option_a,Find some way to get the water to stop gushing.
event_city_campaign_68_option_b,Get the staff out of your room and throw it into the bay.
event_city_campaign_68_result_a_a,"You take a moment to attune yourself to the staff, which you feel now has a direct link another plane. The water stops and you are left with an open gateway."
event_city_campaign_68_result_a_b,"You figure out how to work the staff, but not before your entire room is flooded. The innkeeper will not be happy."
event_city_campaign_68_result_b,"You race out of the inn, trying to minimize the damage caused by the never-ending stream of water. Not knowing what else to do, you head toward the river. Standing on the banks, you shrug and toss the staff into the current. You guess you’ll never know how the staff ended up where it did or why it suddenly turned into a faucet."
event_city_campaign_69_intro,"You are rather surprised to walk into the Brown Door one night
to see your old friend the Soothsinger playing a song on the corner stage. You are even more surprised when you get closer and discover the song is about you.

It is a raucous tale about the time she met you in a forest and you gave her terrible directions—just the worst, most backward directions possible.

Everyone in the crowd is tearing up with laughter as she eloquently describes your bumbling and ineptitude."
event_city_campaign_69_option_a,Embrace the joke and go with it.
event_city_campaign_69_option_b,Leave the bar before someone recognizes you.
event_city_campaign_69_result_a,"You make your way to the front of the crowd and join in the fun. When the Soothsinger notices you in the crowd, she brings you up on stage for the chorus. It’s a little embarrassing, but people are enjoying your positive attitude about it."
event_city_campaign_69_result_b,"You flee the bar to escape the tune, but it doesn’t prove to be that simple. The next day, everyone on the street is humming the tune. They all seems to be looking at you and laughing. It’s a nightmare."
event_city_campaign_6_intro,"You awake in the middle of the night to the sound of alarms ringing in the west. You recognize them as the warning clangs of an attack on the wall.

Any force bold enough to assault the defenses of Gloomhaven can’t be good. For a moment you are grateful for the prolific number of guards defending the city. But still, there is always the possibility that the guards may not be enough."
event_city_campaign_6_option_a,Go aid in the defense of the city. 
event_city_campaign_6_option_b,"If the guards are distracted by an attacking force, now would be the perfect time to steal some valuables."
event_city_campaign_6_result_a,"You rush toward the West Gate, eager to fight back the invaders. As you approach, you see a mass of Vermlings climbing over the wall and attacking the guards with daggers and arrows. You yell and charge into the battle. It is a rough fight, but you emerge victorious, covered in fur and blood. The citizens of Gloomhaven remain safe, and the town is free to grow and prosper."
event_city_campaign_6_result_b,"The town erupts into chaos with panicked cries of “Vermlings!”—a perfect opportunity to collect some valuables.
Slinking around to an abandoned shop, you find a way in and pilfer the safe. In the morning, the devastation from the assault is noticeable. Downtrodden looks greet you as you pass, and you wonder if your presence was missed along the walls."
event_city_campaign_70_intro,"You are wandering the Sinking Market looking for possible work when you are approached by a dirty-looking boy with a scar on his cheek.

You greet him warmly. He has given you leads on a number of mercenary jobs and you recently helped him avoid a jail cell.

“I need some help, and I really don’t know who else to turn to,” he begins. “All of us here in the Sinking Market are in a bad way. Our houses are collapsing, our water is foul, and we don’t even have enough money for food.

“We are dying here, and the city is doing nothing to help us. You have friends in high places, right? Please, there’s gotta be someone you can talk to.”"
event_city_campaign_70_option_a,Talk to some merchants about revitalizing the area.
event_city_campaign_70_option_b,Regretfully explain that you don’t have the power to effect change like this.
event_city_campaign_70_result_a_a,"You head to the Coin District and meet with a member of the
merchant’s guild you’ve had dealings with before. He looks at you skeptically, but says he will see what he can do about making the area more livable."
event_city_campaign_70_result_a_b,Every merchant you try to talk to about the issue laughs you out of the room. Why help others when there is no profit in it for them?
event_city_campaign_70_result_b,"You explain that while you do have some power in the town, the Sinking Market may be a lost cause. More and more of the district is sinking into the sea every day, as it has been doing for as long as the town has existed. You can’t convince merchants to spend money on something that will one day be underwater."
event_city_campaign_71_intro,"You are walking along the river’s edge in the Mixed District late
at night when something in your pack begins to vibrate. The sensation is odd and you quickly fish out the small metal sphere you found out on the road. It shakes uncontrollably and then begins pulling your arm toward the river.

You walk to the bank, but still the sphere pulls. It is drawn to something in the water."
event_city_campaign_71_option_a,Let the sphere go.
event_city_campaign_71_option_b,Jump into the river and continue to follow the sphere’s pull.
event_city_campaign_71_result_a,"The sphere leaps from your hand, hovers over the water, and then emits an intense beam of light straight down into the river, illuminating something below.

You shrug and jump into the river, following the beam of light down to the bottom. There you find a wooden chest half buried under the rocks. You bring it back to shore and open it to find a small metal rod covered in strange carvings. When you pick it up, the sphere immediately flies back over to you and attaches itself to the rod’s end."
event_city_campaign_71_result_b,"As soon as you jump into the cold, brackish waters, the sphere stops vibrating or pulling. You swim for a while in the direction it was pulling, but eventually you realize you are on a fool’s errand. You emerge from the river wet and miserable with absolutely nothing to show for it."
event_city_campaign_72_intro,"The metal sphere and rod—you’ve had them in your possession for a while now and occasionally pull them out to mull over the carvings. You’ve brought it to the University, but they can’t make any sense of it either.

You are fiddling with the device in the Sleeping Lion when you are tapped on the shoulder. You turn to see a wicked grin on the dirty face of a old bandit. “They call me Fish, and that there is a key, friend—a key of the ancient sort.”

Before you can ask, Fish pulls out a similar black sphere atop a metal rod. “They’re twins, ain’t they, and Fish knows just what they open. A tomb of treasure, friend. Come, come, Fish will show you the way.”"
event_city_campaign_72_option_a,Follow the smelly old bandit.
event_city_campaign_72_option_b,Refuse to go with the man. This whole situation seems...fishy.
event_city_campaign_72_result_a,"Your curiosity gets the better of your judgment. You need to know the purpose of the device you found, so you follow Fish into a derelict shack where he pulls out a map of the area and lays it on a table. Fish directs you to pull out your rod and both you and he hold your respective rods over the table.

A specific location on the map glows brightly and Fish laughs. “See? I told ya, didn’t I? Meet me there with your rod and we’ll get rich!”"
event_city_campaign_72_result_b,This suspicious old man must have seen you in here before with the rod and fashioned some elaborate con to swindle you out of something. You won’t be so easily fooled. There’s no way he knows what the rod does when no one else in town does. You push him away and go back to your drink.
event_city_campaign_73_intro,"You awake in your bed to sensation of someone shaking you, but when you look around, you see no one else in your room. Instead, you see that it’s the entire room that’s shaking.

Your thoughts immediately go to the crystal you found inside the mountain along the road. You quickly search through your belongings and grab the crystal in your hand. The earthquake immediately stops.

Clearly this thing has some power and you need to deal with it before more damage is done."
event_city_campaign_73_option_a,Seek help from the University.
event_city_campaign_73_option_b,Throw the crystal into the bay. 
event_city_campaign_73_result_a,"“Yes, very interesting,” a bookish Quatryl says as he rolls the crystal over in his hand. “It seems as if this crystal is attuned to a specific location, and once removed, it begins vibrating until mountains and houses start falling down. I’d say you need to return it to its proper home. With the proper tools—which I’ll need help paying for—I should be able to triangulate that location for you.”"
event_city_campaign_73_result_b,"Not wanting to waste your time with the problem, you walk to the docks and throw the crystal into the bay. When you hear
reports of harsher weather and larger waves hitting the docks, you try not to pay them any mind."
event_city_campaign_74_intro,"“Welcome to the Marvelous and Magic Techno-Circus!” The Quatryl with a top hat you met on the road greets you as you enter the circus tent. “We always welcome our friends to come and see the wondrous sights!”

You wander around the pavilion for a while, looking at all signs for all manner of improbable creatures. Ultimately you will have to decide on what to see first."
event_city_campaign_74_option_a,Go watch the dancing bear.
event_city_campaign_74_option_b,Visit the famed fortune-teller.
event_city_campaign_74_result_a,"You enter a smaller tent off the main one and come face-to-face with what is indeed a dancing bear. Its handler stands to the side, prodding it on occasion, while the bear stands on its hind two legs and shuffles back and forth. It is amusing until the handler prods the bear one too many times and the bear becomes enraged and attacks. You quickly jump into action and subdue the bear, saving the handler from getting mauled to death."
event_city_campaign_74_result_b,"You enter the fortune-teller’s tent and the old Orchid woman’s expression immediately goes dark. She gestures you to sit at her table, and when you do, she grabs your arm and looks deep into your eyes.

“Your path is dark and cursed. There is a shadow around you—a Gloom. You must leave this place. Be rid of it before it consumes you.”"
event_city_campaign_75_intro,"Returning to Gloomhaven after your latest outing, you are approached by the Captain of the Guard at the city gates.

“Ah, I was hoping I might catch you here sooner or later,” he says. “I have still been receiving reports about large, flying lizards from the scouts. Tell me, have you gotten to the bottom of that situation yet?”"
event_city_campaign_75_option_a,Lie and say that you are still working on it.
event_city_campaign_75_option_b,Tell the Captain you decided not to kill the Elder Drake.
event_city_campaign_75_result_a,"“Oh, hmm...well, that’s disappointing.” The Captain looks at you with dejected frustration. “If you could, please look into the sightings as soon as you can. I’d hate to think of some giant flying creature attacking the city.”"
event_city_campaign_75_result_b,"“Oh, my...well, okay.” The Captain looks at you with stunned curiosity. “So there is a massive, fire-breathing drake up in the mountains, and you decided there was no reason to kill it? Interesting.”

The Captain wanders off, mumbling about needing to find better help."
event_city_campaign_76_intro,"You are walking through the new docks when a well-dressed
merchant flags you down.

“Oh, my, what a fortuitous encounter,” he whispers as you approach. “May I buy you a drink? I have a very sensitive job for you, and I’d like to avoid the prying eyes around us.”

The merchant, an iron dealer named Gavin, makes a gesture toward a large group of dock workers. “I can’t trust anyone. Well, anyone except you of course.”"
event_city_campaign_76_option_a,Accept the drink. 
event_city_campaign_76_option_b,Decline the suspicious offer and continue your business.
event_city_campaign_76_result_a_a,"“Excellent! Someone has been attacking my ships at sea and I need to get to the bottom of it. Come, I’ll tell you the details.”"
event_city_campaign_76_result_a_b,"“Oh, whoops,” Gavin stammers. “From far away, you looked like someone else. Just ignore what I said.”"
event_city_campaign_76_result_b,Gavin looks flabbergasted as you walk away. “Who will protect my ships when there is no one to trust? I guess I’ll just have to keep looking.”
event_city_campaign_77_intro,"“Well, well, well. If it isn’t the most notorious band of mercenaries in all of Gloomhaven. The guards looking to throw you in the Ghost Fortress yet, or are they on the payroll?”

You turn around to see Red Nick, a well-known fence, leaning up against the wall. You’ve had certain dealings with him in the past.

“Fancy seeing you, actually,” he says. “I’ve got a big job, and I figure if anyone wouldn’t mind digging up graves, it would be you miscreants.”"

event_city_campaign_77_option_b,Claim you’ve changed your ways and grave robbing is a step too far.
event_city_campaign_77_result_a_a,"“That’s the money-loving criminals I know and love! Come take a walk with me, and I’ll explain how we can all get rich.”"
event_city_campaign_77_result_a_b,"“Oh, whoops,” Nick stammers. “From the back you looked like...uh, never mind. Forget I said anything.”"
event_city_campaign_77_result_b,"“A downright shame, I say.” Nick shakes his head. “I guess I’ll just have to find a group of mercenaries who actually are interested in making a mountain of money.”"
event_city_campaign_78_intro,"The scene is typical. A nervous-looking man stands in front of your table at the Sleeping Lion. You eye him lazily until he speaks.

“I was, um, told you might be able to help me,” he starts. “I was in the Corpsewood conducting some, uh, business, when my partners and I were attacked by Vermlings. I barely escaped with my life, but my partners weren’t so lucky.

“One of them was carrying something valuable—an artifact we managed to find in our, uh, business. It’s very important I get it back. I followed the Vermlings back to their nest, and I can assure you they have many valuables. I’ll show you where it is, and you can take whatever you want. Just bring me back the artifact.”"
event_city_campaign_78_option_a,Accept the man's deal.
event_city_campaign_78_option_b,Demand payment for the job up-front.
event_city_campaign_78_result_a,"The sweaty man is all too eager to give you the details of where to find this nest.

“One you clear the Vermlings and find the artifact, you should be able to locate a large stash of valuables in a pit back behind the main camp. Take whatever you want, just return the artifact to me.”

You smile and nod. After taking the valuables, you should be able to squeeze quite a bit extra out of this fellow as well when you return."
event_city_campaign_78_result_b,"“Look...I, ah, don’t have a whole lot of capital right now, but I will give you everything I have once you get back with that artifact.”

You narrow your eyes at him. He coughs nervously and produces a small handful of coins.

“All right, fine. Look, here. This is all I can offer you. Now can we get to the part where you go do your job?”"
event_city_campaign_79_intro,"The sun is out and you are enjoying a pleasant stroll across the Silent Bridge until you see two demons attacking a man ahead of you.

You get closer and can hear the demons berating the man as they swipe at him with their claws.

“You dare spit on us as we walk past?” One of them yells. “We will show you the consequences of defying authority!”"
event_city_campaign_79_option_a,Intervene on the man's behalf.
event_city_campaign_79_option_b,Keep walking. 
event_city_campaign_79_result_a,"There is only one method these demons respect: violence. You run forward and hack at one of the demons’ arms as it comes down to strike at the man. The arm falls limp to the ground and the rest of the demon soon follows.

The other demon looks at you with seething rage as you face it with raised weapons. “This grave insult will not go unpunished! This city will feel our wrath!”"
event_city_campaign_79_result_b,"You continue your stroll, trying to block the unpleasantness from your mind. Unfortunately, others around you cannot, and they are reminded of the actions you took that caused this horrible and all-too-frequent occurrence."
event_city_campaign_7_intro,"Occasionally your dealings in town lead you past the bustling
docks. All conversation gets drowned out by the constant din of loading and unloading cargo and crew. This makes it all
the more surprising when you hear a voice above the noise directed straight at you.

“Oi! You with the hard looks and big arms! I desperately need some help o’er here! Spare a few minutes to help make sure I get out of port on time? Otherwise I’ll be stuck here until tomorrow!”"
event_city_campaign_7_option_a,Help the captain load his ship.
event_city_campaign_7_option_b,Move on with your business. You don't have the time or inclination for such things. 
event_city_campaign_7_result_a,"What was advertised as a few minutes turns out to be an hour or two as you lug large crates full of some foul-smelling liquid from a nearby warehouse into the hold of the ship. At least the captain is relieved that he’ll be able to set sail on time, though. He gratefully pays you, but you can’t help but think that such menial labor might be beneath you."
event_city_campaign_7_result_b,"Unwilling to be bothered by such trivial matters, you continue on your way amidst curses from the ship’s captain. “Blast it all! You’ll get nowhere in life with that sort of attitude!”"
event_city_campaign_80_intro,"As you prepare to leave the city on another journey, you are suddenly surrounded by a large group of guards near the west gate.

“We hear you’ve been spreading rumors,” one of them says. “Claiming that the guards are causing the Vermling attacks on the city. That’s some high-grade garbage you’re spewing.”

“My best friend died in the last Vermling raid!” another one yells. “You got something smart to say about that?”"
event_city_campaign_80_option_a,Attempt to calm down the guards and explain the situation.
event_city_campaign_80_option_b,These guards are not interested in a friendly discourse. Prepare to defend yourself.
event_city_campaign_80_result_a_a,"You adopt a serious tone and do your best to communicate that you had nothing to do with what was written in the Town Records. You express remorse for their hardships, and, miraculously, the mob grows calmer and disperses."
event_city_campaign_80_result_a_b,"You laugh and claim that this is all some big misunderstanding. The guards don’t see it that way, but your lack of aggression at least stops them from attacking you. They leave, grumbling threats."
event_city_campaign_80_result_b,"Seeing the situation turning south, you waste no time pulling your weapons and prepare for an attack. The guards are more than happy to oblige.

Luckily your foes sustain only some minor injuries in the time it takes for another squad of guards to arrive and break up the scuffle. They let you go on your way, but you can see the disdain in all of their eyes."
event_city_campaign_81_intro,"“Hey, aren’t you the mercenaries who stopped that weird tornado from destroying the city?”

You turn to see a dirty dock worker pointing at you with wonder in his eyes. “What was that all about anyway?”

More people stop and stare at you. This has become an unfortunately common occurrence since the Gloom was destroyed. You have become something of a minor celebrity in Gloomhaven."
event_city_campaign_81_option_a,Take the time to relate the story of what happened. 
event_city_campaign_81_option_b,Claim it wasn't you and leave quickly. 
event_city_campaign_81_result_a,"You smile and nod, explaining how an ancient force attempted to destroy the city, but it was banished to another plane. Everyone around you stands enraptured by your story and cheers and claps at its conclusion.

After a few additional questions, you are finally able extricate yourself from the crowd and continue your business."
event_city_campaign_81_result_b,"You brusquely shake your head and wave your hand away, saying the man has the wrong person. His excited face immediately turns to one of disappointment. And audible sigh of dejection emerges from the crowd as you rush away.

“There’s no need to be rude about it!” the dockworker yells at your back."
event_city_campaign_8_intro,"On a trip to the New Market, you see a curious sea chart
prominently displayed in a Valrath merchant’s stall.

“Ah, I see this interests you!” he says while holding it up, taking great care not to damage it. “I’ve been told this map will lead you to a location of untold riches! Wondrous beyond anything you have seen before!”

The Valrath gestures grandly with his free hand and his smile grows wide. “How can you say no to this? Just make me an offer."""
event_city_campaign_8_option_a,The map does look valuable. Decide to bargain for it. 
event_city_campaign_8_option_b,Refuse to deal with the merchant. 
event_city_campaign_8_result_a_a,"After some amount of haggling back and forth, you settle on a price and pay for the map. You recognize some of the landmarks and should be able to find this place of “untold treasure” by hiring a ship."
event_city_campaign_8_result_a_b,"Despite your valiant efforts, you cannot get the merchant to lower his price to something you can afford."
event_city_campaign_8_result_b,"Wary of the merchant’s overly exuberant nature, you politely decline his offer and go about your intended business."
event_city_campaign_9_intro,"After a night of heavy drinking, you get turned around while navigating the back alleys and find yourself standing before a collapsed section of bricked road that leads down into
an underground tunnel.

Fueled by curiosity and a bit of liquid courage, you descend in search of adventure. Stumbling around in the vast network of tunnels proves rather fruitless, however, until a well-concealed
passage leads you to a long-forgotten stash of weaponry and dried food.

The stuff could fetch a decent price at the Sunken Market, or you could turn it over to the city guard, which is always in need arms and rations."
event_city_campaign_9_option_a,Sell the goods.
event_city_campaign_9_option_b,Donate the goods to the city. 
event_city_campaign_9_result_a,"Using a few less-than-savory contacts, you’re able to unload the goods for a respectable price. Who knew drunken strolls could prove so profitable?"
event_city_campaign_9_result_b,"You sleep off the previous night’s revelries and approach the Captain of the Guard. “This is wonderful news! With attacks on
the city becoming ever more frequent, our blacksmiths are having trouble keeping up with our demands. And the food should help considerably if we ever find ourselves under siege. This is truly a big help to the city.”"
event_duel,"You hear the clashes and clangs of what sounds like a fight taking place up ahead. As you draw near, you see a Savvas and an Inox locked in a fierce duel.

They both notice your arrival and call to you for aid."
event_duel_a,Help the Savvas
event_duel_a_unavailable,Brute: 'Kill Inox over Savvas? No.'

event_duel_breakup_gained_damage,"You leap into their midst in attempt to break up the fight - but at that exact moment the Savvas summons spikes of earth from the ground intended for the Inox.

Despite injuries sustained from the spikes you successfully manage to drag them away from each other, allowing them to calm down.

Without explaining why they were fighting, they each wrest themselves from your grasp and storm off, heading down the path in opposite directions."
event_duel_breakup_gained_item,"You leap into their midst in attempt to break up the fight - however, each thinks that you've joined the other's side and they both flee!

In the confusion, one of them drops a ¬Duel_BreakUp.Item¬. You pick it up and continue down the road, wondering what the two of them were fighting about."

event_duel_helpsavvas_gained_infusions,"You side with the Savvas, and the Inox flees, seeing he is outnumbered.

The Savvas thanks you for your assistance, but apologises for not having anything tangible to give you as thanks.

Before you part ways however, the four power cores in his chest glow brightly as he offers you elemental aid for your next encounter, infusing the four elements he has attained mastery over for you."
event_duel_helpsavvas_gained_item,"You side with the Savvas, and the Inox flees, seeing he is outnumbered. The Savvas thanks you for your assistance, and hands you a potion before bidding you farewell."
event_duel_leave,"You decide not to interfere, and continue down the path, the sounds of their battling fading as you walk away."
event_road_campaign_10_intro,"You have only just wandered off the main road in search of your destination when the ground begins to shift beneath your feet. 

What was once solid now gives way, and you find yourself falling down into a dark pit. You land twenty feet down, cushioned by the soil that fell with you. 

You stand up with alertness and look around, trying to get your bearings. You have fallen into a man-made cavern with some smooth stone walls and floors. 

This could be a trap or just some long-forgotten structure. "
event_road_campaign_10_option_a,Use weights and ropes to climb out of the hole as quickly as possible. 
event_road_campaign_10_option_b,Explore the area. 
event_road_campaign_10_result_a,"You tie one of your weapons to a long rope and manage to hook it onto a sturdy tree root hanging over the pit. With enough effort, you are able to extricate yourself from the pit and get as far away as possible before the situation gets worse. You suffered some minor scrapes and bruises in the fall, but you cound yourself lucky. "
event_road_campaign_10_result_b,"Lighting a torch, you see a number of passages leading you out of the stone room. Unfazed, you head down one of them and begin exploring the network of chambers. In one, you find a pedestal and, sitting atop that, a small, metal sphere. 

You take the strange sphere and continue your search, but the only other remarkable thing you find is an exit. "
event_road_campaign_11_intro,"You are headed through a mountainous region when the ground begins to shift and shake beneath you. Taken off your guard, you fall to your knees. 

The tremors continue unabated and grow stronger. You hear rumbling as rocks begin to tumble down the mountainside."
event_road_campaign_11_option_a,Try to find a clearing where you can avoid the falling rocks.
event_road_campaign_11_option_b,Take cover under a nearby outcropping and wait out the earthquake. 
event_road_campaign_11_result_a,"You race forward, scanning the area for an open space where the danger from rock slides will be less severe. After dodging some rocks and getting hit by others, you find a relatively safe area and wait for the chaos to subside. "
event_road_campaign_11_result_b_a,"You jump under an outcropping, but something is not right. Those among you tuned to the elements turn toward the face of the mountain and step into it, as though the rocks were gone, Inside, you see an odd crystal jutting out of the earth. You snatch it up, and the tremors stop. "
event_road_campaign_11_result_b_b,The outcropping proves to be an unstable place to hide. You are quickly buried in rubble. 
event_road_campaign_12_intro,"A rustling in a nearby thicket stops you in your tracks. You crouch down and assume a defensive stance. 

Suddenly, a tiny ball of fur with short, stubby legs leaps out at you, It barks at you twice in a ineffectual, high-pitched tone and then begins to wag its tail. 

You relax your weapons. What is such a small, defensive puppy doing out in the wilderness?"
event_road_campaign_12_option_a,Leave the puppy to fend for itself.
event_road_campaign_12_option_b,Take the puppy and bring it back to Gloomhaven.
event_road_campaign_12_result_a,"Adorable as the puppy is, you are not the ones to care for it. You are headed into danger, and you can't let anything distract you from the task at hand. It follows you for a while, barking in indignation, but it eventually wanders off. "
event_road_campaign_12_result_b,"You sigh and lift the puppy into your arms. It barks happily and licks your face. This will surely prove a distraction in your upcoming battle, but once you get back to Gloomhaven, you should be able to find it a nice home. "
event_road_campaign_13_intro,"Traveling off the beaten path, you are surprised to see a large group of figures on the horizon. You take out your weapons and move cautiously forward. 

As you get closer, it becomes clear that the figures are not alive, but sculptures of some kind, make haphazardly out of branches, garbage, and scrap metal. There are fifty or so in the middle of a field, with no other signs of life as far as you can see. 

You see a necklace that may be valuable on one of them and go to grab it.

""Don't touch her!"" You wheel around to see an old man in rags emerge from a hole in the ground and charge at you with a broken broom handle. ""These women are all mine!"""
event_road_campaign_13_option_a,Defend yourself with lethal force.
event_road_campaign_13_option_b,Attempt to calm down the hermit and resolve the situation peacefully. 
event_road_campaign_13_result_a,"With a single swing of your sword, the old man's head separates from his body and tumbles to the ground. The stench coming from his rags is terrible, so you grab what valuables you can find and quickly move on. "
event_road_campaign_13_result_b,"You grab the broom handle and wrestle the old man to the ground, attempting to restrain his flailing limbs. You try to explain that this is all a misunderstanding, but he just keeps warning you not to defecate on his wives. The man is surprisingly agile, and the stench of his rags also makes keeping him pinned difficult. He slips free and scrambles around for his broom handle, muttering about the ""stars' gift."" You run away with haste, but his odor is much harder to escape. "
event_road_campaign_14_intro,"You are walking down the road when the sound of many wings pulls your gaze to the sky. Above you, you see a large flock of white birds flying southward. 

At that height, you figure a well-aimed arrow could bring one of them down to make a nice meal. "
event_road_campaign_14_option_a,Shoot at the birds. 
event_road_campaign_14_option_b,Let the birds pass undisturbed. 
event_road_campaign_14_result_a,"You pull back your bow and take aim. The arrow flies true and connects with one of the birds. You retrieve it, pluck it, cook it, and eat it. Definitely beats the field rations you carry with you. "
event_road_campaign_14_result_b,"The shot would be difficult, and you'd prefer not to waste the arrow. You simply move on toward your destination.  "
event_road_campaign_15_intro,"You are walking down the road when the sound of many wings pulls your gaze to the sky. Above you, you see a large flock of red birds flying southward. 

At that height, you figure a well-aimed arrow could bring one of them down to make a nice meal. "
event_road_campaign_15_option_a,Shoot at the birds. 
event_road_campaign_15_option_b,Let the birds pass undisturbed. 
event_road_campaign_15_result_a,"You pull back your bow and take aim. The instant you loose the arrow, however; you notice something odd about the birds. They are much farther away than you realised, and much bigger. The arrow misses, but it gets their attention. As the flock turns and descends toward you, you realize you just shot at a group of drakes. You run for cover among the trees, but are hit by their acidic spit a number of times in the process.  "
event_road_campaign_15_result_b,"The shot would be difficult, and you'd prefer not to waste the arrow. You simply move on toward your destination.  "
event_road_campaign_16_intro,"The route to your destination is less direct than you had hoped, and you end up taking a shortcut through a small forest. 

There you happen upon a family of deer. They are still a ways off in the distance and haven't noticed you. 

You approach cautiously. "
event_road_campaign_16_option_a,Shoot at one of the deer. 
event_road_campaign_16_option_b,Just watch the deer for a little bit. 
event_road_campaign_16_result_a,"You notch your bow and take a few steps forward to find a better shooting position. Unfortunately, the deer notice your presence and bound off. You shoot a few arrows as they go, but nothing connects. 

Then an arrow flies out of the brush and into your shoulder. ""Foul city-dwellers!"" a voice cries out from the trees. ""I had been stalking that herd for hours and you spooked them!"" More arrows rain down as you run away. "
event_road_campaign_16_result_b,"You are enjoying watching the animals graze when an arrow flies out and hits the larger of the deer in its center chest. It bolts away, but doesn't make it very far before collapsing.

Then you see a large Inox emerge from the brush and turn toward you. ""I thought you were going to do something stupid there for a second. Thanks for not scaring away my quarry. Allow me to share some of the spoils with you."" "
event_road_campaign_17_intro,"Not far outside Gloomhaven, you look up to see a large bird flying overhead. Something is odd, though. Its movements are jerky, and there is smoke billowing out of it. Then you see it plunge into a sudden nose-dive and crash to the ground off in the east. 

You rush to the scene and find a limping, soot-covered Quatryl kicking a giant winged contraption made of leather and metal.

""Curse this wretched thing!"" He yells in frustration. ""I thought I'd worked it out, and then I suddenly lost pressure in the piston chamber!""

He looks over at you. ""You there! Wonderful timing!"" Help me get this thing back into the air. There is no time to waste!"""
event_road_campaign_17_option_a,Do whatever the Quatryl says. 
event_road_campaign_17_option_b,Demand an explanation before you help in any way. 
event_road_campaign_17_result_a,"You set the wings and bang out a few dents while the Quatryl repairs his pressure problem. In under an hour, the Quatryl declares the contraption airworthy and jumps in the cockpit. You stand clear and watch in awe as the thing begins flapping wildly, then sputters forward and lifts off the ground. 

Unfortunately, the flight is short-lived, and the second crash is not nearly as forgiving. You find the Quatryl dead on impact, and there's nothing more to do except harvest the machine for valuable parts. "
event_road_campaign_17_result_b,"You force the Quatryl to slow down and talk to you, but his eyes keep darting around in a panic. ""Don't you understand? The world needs my technology now! I must perfect it! It will revolutionize everything!""

You agree that the power of flight is pretty great, but you convince the Quatryl that the world can wait a day for him to get some rest and organize his thoughts. You help him transport the broken machine back to town. "
event_road_campaign_18_intro,"The road contains many dangers, the chief among them are the barbaric tribes of Inox that inhabit the wilderness around the city. This is why your heart sinks when you see a mounted group of them ride up to you and surround your party. 

""Ah, agents of that wretched monstrosity you call a town,"" the largest of the Inox says as he looks down at you. ""Tell me, scum. What business do you have out here on my land? Have those fools sent you out to murder more of my people?""  "
event_road_campaign_18_option_a,Attempt to come to a peaceful resolution.
event_road_campaign_18_option_b,"Attack the insulting, contemptuous Inox. "
event_road_campaign_18_result_a_a,"You begin to agree with the Inox that Gloomhaven is a blight on the land in need of cleansing, and the Inox seems to believe you. ""Go in peace, then,"" the leader says. ""And stay off my land."""
event_road_campaign_18_result_a_b,"You try to explain that you mean the Inox no ill will, but the leader eyes you skeptically. ""Foul creature. I curse you and your kind! Run—get off my land and never come back!"""
event_road_campaign_18_result_b,"Enraged by the Inox's insulting tongue, you take up your weapons and attack. Even the Inox were not expecting a move so bold. The fight is brutal, especially with your enemy mounted, but after felling a number of their warriors, the rest retreat. "
event_road_campaign_19_intro,"Heading down the main road, you see an odd-looking wagon in front of you. It is covered in metal bars and a number of ragged men in chains walk behind it. On either side of the wagon, you see city guards on horseback keeping a watchful eye on everything. 

You get closer and one of the guards calls out to you. ""Keep your distance! We are transporting dangerous criminals.""

A moment later, one of the prisoners in back slips out of his manacles and behins to sprint full speed into the tall grass. "
event_road_campaign_19_option_a,Help the guards catch their escaping man.
event_road_campaign_19_option_b,Interfere with the guards to help the man escape. 
event_road_campaign_19_result_a_a,"You chase after the sprinting man, but the guards conclude you must be an accomplice trying to help him. They shoot arrows in your direction, forcing you to retreat from the situation. "
event_road_campaign_19_result_a_b,"The man's speed after spending months in jail is no match for your own. With the help of the guards on horseback, you quickly have him cornered and returned to the wagon."
event_road_campaign_19_result_b,"Criminals deserve freedom as much as the next man. While the guards are distracted by the one escapee, you rush to the wagon and release the others. Chaos erupts as the prisoners scatter in every direction. Many manage to escape, and you find a mysterious gift of thanks waiting on your doorstep when you return to Gloomhaven. "
event_road_campaign_1_intro,"""Heading out a little late, aren't you?"" The guard at the wall looks at you passively. You grunt in response and head through the opened gate.

""Nobody's gonna go looking for your corpse if you don't return!"" the guard shouts at your back.

You end up embarking out on the road much later than you had hoped—events in town saw to that—but as the dusk settles on the horizon you feel confident that you are up to any threat you might face.

And then begins the howling of wolves—vicious, foul beasts—and, judging from their sounds, they seem to be getting closer."
event_road_campaign_1_option_a,Run from the howling to safety. 
event_road_campaign_1_option_b,Let the wolves come. 
event_road_campaign_1_result_a,"You pick up and run as fast as you can through the underbrush and away from the ominous sounds. They seem to be receding as you stumble headlong into some sort of thicket filled with sticky spines. 

You pull yourself out, but not before your skin is pierced in numerous places and becomes inflamed. Best to avoid this plant in the future."
event_road_campaign_1_result_b,"Confident that the wolves pose no significant threat, you stand your ground and prepare for battle. The pack comes—ragged and hungry, slowly emerging from the dark— and surrounds your party. 

There are more of them than you expected, but not enough to take you down. You suffer a bite or two, but are able to fight them off. "
event_road_campaign_20_intro,"You are trudging through some foothills when you hear the strangest sound in the distance. It sounds vaguely like wolves howling, but higher pitched, and there is a rhythm and a melody to it.

You crest a nearby hill and survey the area, spying a pack of Vermlings standing in a circle and singing. “Singing” is the best way you can think to describe it, anyway. Occasionally during the song they also clap and dance around."
event_road_campaign_20_option_a,The song must serve some nefarious purpose. Attack the Vermlings. 
event_road_campaign_20_option_b,Move closer and enjoy the music. 
event_road_campaign_20_result_a,"You take the pack by surprise. Fully distracted by their ritual, they don't even see you coming. The Vermlings still get in a few good attacks before they are slain, though. "
event_road_campaign_20_result_b,"Not wanting to disturb the ritual, you inch a little closer, staying out of sight, and then sit and listen. They go through a number of different tunes, and you feel enriched by the experience. "
event_road_campaign_21_intro,"You find yourself cutting through the dense underbrush of a forest when you notice a number of small woodland animals running along the forest floor in the opposite direction.

Mice, squirrels, ferrets—they all appear to be running from something up ahead of you. You are filled with a troubling sense of foreboding as you catch a whiff of smoke in the air."
event_road_campaign_21_option_a,Keep moving forward. 
event_road_campaign_21_option_b,Follow the animal's cue and run in the opposite direction. 
event_road_campaign_21_result_a,"By the time you see the flames, it is too late. A great forest fire is raging around you. You try to run, but you don’t make it out of the blaze without serious injuries and smoke
inhalation."
event_road_campaign_21_result_b,"Fearing the worst, you turn around and head out of the forest the way you came in. You reach a clearing just before a great fire consumes everything with its blaze. It takes a while to orient yourself and find the road again, but considering the alternative, you feel lucky."
event_road_campaign_22_intro,"There was a heavy rain last night, and the roads are now dark streaks of mud. And as bad as it is for you walking, you see that others up ahead on the road are having worse trouble. You come upon a collection of wagons stuck in the mud on the side of the road.

You look around and see an odd assortment of people dressed in garish clothing. They are working to push their brightly painted wagons, all emblazoned with a “Marvelous and Magical Techno-Circus” logo, out of the muck.

“We just stopped for a quick meal, and now the wheels have sunk into this mess,” a Quatryl with a fancy top hat says as you approach. “I’m sure our strongmen will get us out eventually, but we certainly wouldn’t begrudge a little extra help.”"
event_road_campaign_22_option_a,Help push out the Quatryl ringmaster's wagon.
event_road_campaign_22_option_b,Help push out the fortune-teller's wagon.
event_road_campaign_22_result_a,"You put down some boards and then heave and push until the great wagon is out of the ditch and moving back on the road. The diminutive Quatryl tips his hat.

“Well, I certainly could not have done that on my own. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. I tell you what—the next time
we’re back in Gloomhaven, why don’t you stop by our circus, and we’ll let you in for free.”"
event_road_campaign_22_result_b,"You take pity on an old Orchid woman trying to extricate her fortune-teller’s wagon by herself. You help her get it back on the road, and then she grabs you and looks deep into your eyes.

“Your path is dark and cursed. There is a shadow around you—a Gloom. You must leave this place. Be rid of it before it consumes you.”"
event_road_campaign_23_intro,"A knapsack and a walking stick on the side of the road catch your attention as you pass. You look around and see a man squatting in the bushes a small distance away.

“Oh, hello!” he says. “Good timing, actually. You wouldn’t mind grabbing me some leaves, would you? It’s seems I’ve made quite a mess over here.”"
event_road_campaign_23_option_a,Bring the man some leaves. 
event_road_campaign_23_option_b,Grab his stuff and run off while he's indisposed. 
event_road_campaign_23_result_a,"You gather up a handful of leaves and walk over to him. If you weren’t quite sure what was going on before, the smell definitely confirms it.

“Thanks a lot!” he says cheerily. “Sometimes nature calls, am I right?”

You cough in affirmation and quickly move
on."
event_road_campaign_23_result_b,"You look from the squatting man down to his bag. Surely he has something of value in there. You quickly grab it and run off down the road.

“Hey!” the man yells at you. “What are you doing? My stuff!”

You don’t look back."
event_road_campaign_24_intro,"You come across a group of brow-beaten Inox trudging down the path in the opposite direction as you. Some are pulling carts laden with various miscellany, mostly furs and crudely crafted goods. The rest have armloads of much of the same.

It is obvious that this is everything the Inox have—their life’s worth in their arms and wagons. They are all covered in what appears to be soot. 

The shaman at the head of the group calls to you. “The beast awakens! The mountain is aflame! Beware you do not anger it!”

Looking to the horizon, you can see black smoke rising from a far-off peak."
event_road_campaign_24_option_a,Aid the Inox with what they are carrying. 
event_road_campaign_24_option_b,Ignore the Shaman's ramblings. 
event_road_campaign_24_result_a,"You take pity on the disheveled group of Inox, forced from their home by a natural disaster. You travel with them for a time, treating their wounds and helping to lighten their loads.

The Shaman thanks you and hands you an amulet. “We can’t return to our homes until the Beast rests. I fear what this may mean for us all. I hope this keeps you safe.”"
event_road_campaign_24_result_b,"You brush off the plight of the Inox tribe, but as you continue to your destination, you begin to feel a certain amount of unease. There is a slight tremble in the soles of your feet, and, in the distance, the black cloud of smoke grows."
event_road_campaign_25_intro,"You are far off the main road when you see a small band of Inox approaching from the west. You try to divert your path to go around them, but they are moving directly into your path.

In a few minutes’ time, they overtake you.

“You’ve wandered into our territory, travelers,” the biggest one says. “We don’t much like visitors.”

You stare at her blankly.

“Such acts can be forgiven, but it will cost you.”"
event_road_campaign_25_option_a,Try to reason with the Inox. 
event_road_campaign_25_option_b,Fight off the Inox. They'll get no payments from you. 
event_road_campaign_25_result_a_a,"The Inox in your party talks with the leader for a while and they are able to come to an agreement. They punch each other’s chests, and the group lets you through."
event_road_campaign_25_result_a_b,"The Inox don’t seem to be budging on this payment issue, so you are forced to pass along a handful of coins. The big one smiles and lets you continue on your way."
event_road_campaign_25_result_b,"You raise your weapons and state that no payments will be made this day. The group of Inox snarls and attacks. After you land a few solid blows, though, they break off and run away back to the west, leaving you to tend to your wounds"
event_road_campaign_26_intro,"You see a lone wagon off to the side of the road up ahead. You approach cautiously.

As you near, a jovial man with a wide hat waves at you. “Ho there! I don’t suppose you have any expertise in fixing a broken axle? The road wasn’t even that bumpy, and then BAM!” The man claps his hands together.

“Just splits in half. I need to have all these goods up
north in two days, and I am just at a loss about how
to get myself out of this pickle!”"
event_road_campaign_26_option_a,Attempt to help the man with his axle problem.
event_road_campaign_26_option_b,Tie up the man and take all of the goods he is so concerned about. 
event_road_campaign_26_result_a_a,"The man talks the whole way through the process, but after an hour or so, the axle is repaired and the man leaves in a radiant mood, bestowing blessings upon you."
event_road_campaign_26_result_a_b,"You happily agree to help the man, but quickly realize you don’t know what you are doing. The man thanks you anyway, and you move on."
event_road_campaign_26_result_b,"You smile widely and approach the man. He doesn’t even put up a fight. The first thing you do is gag him, because he is a talker. You select the lightest of the valuables to take with you and leave the man tied up on the side of the road. You could say his day just went from bad to worse, but that’s not your problem."
event_road_campaign_27_intro,"Walking a path between a small grove and a steep cliff, you suddenly find yourself facing a massive group of felled trees
blocking the road.

The placement of the trees seems odd, and you have a wary, suspicious feeling about the whole situation."
event_road_campaign_27_option_a,Clear the trees from the road. It is the best way through and will help other travelers. 
event_road_campaign_27_option_b,Take the time to find a way around the trees. 
event_road_campaign_27_result_a_a,"The trees are too massive and dense to remove through conventional means, but with elemental power, they are destroyed and swept aside in no time."
event_road_campaign_27_result_a_b,"The trees aren’t part of an ambush, but that doesn’t make them any easier to clear. It’s grueling work and by the time you arrive at your destination, you are exhausted."
event_road_campaign_27_result_b,"You head into the underbrush of the grove to get around the felled trees, but it is rough going. The growth is very dense and there are quite a few prickly thorns to contend with."
event_road_campaign_28_intro,"As you walk down a dirt path, you see a hard-looking mercenary sitting in a patch of grass. He nods as you pass.

“Hey, friends,” he says. There is something off about his tone, though.

“I don’t suppose one of you might be willing to part with a stamina potion, would you? I’m headed toward Gloomhaven, but I’ve just come such a long way, and I’m not feeling too good about the stretch I have left.”

With the clank of his sword sheath against his armor and a loud groan, the man stands up. “I’ll pay you well for it.”"
event_road_campaign_28_option_a,Sell the man a stamina potion. 
event_road_campaign_28_option_b,Politely decline and move quickly on your way. 
event_road_campaign_28_result_a,"After some oddly tense negotiations, you are able to agree upon a price. With one hand firmly on his sword hilt, the man grabs a coin pouch with the other hand and extends it toward you. You exchange goods and continue on your journey
without further incident."
event_road_campaign_28_result_b,There was something off-putting about that man. You are more than happy to move along and put some distance between you.
event_road_campaign_29_intro,"Walking among some foothills, you enter a narrow valley and find a large pile of stones blocking your way. Clearly a rock slide occurred here recently.


You move closer to the pile and despair at just how large the stones are. Only someone of great strength and skill could clear a path efficiently."
event_road_campaign_29_option_a,Attempt to clear the stones from the path. 
event_road_campaign_29_option_b,Backtrack and find a way around the stone-filled valley. 
event_road_campaign_29_result_a_a,"The Cragheart’s combination of raw strength and an affinity for stonework is perfect for this task. In a matter of minutes, enough stones have been destroyed or thrown aside to open a path."
event_road_campaign_29_result_a_b,"The situation is not ideal, but you work through the pain. By the time a path has been cleared away, you never want
to see another rock in your life."
event_road_campaign_29_result_b,"You sigh and turn around. After some backward progress, you find another path through the foothills and work your way
through it. Unfortunately, it leads you directly into a den of wolves, and they don’t seem too happy about your sudden
arrival. You fend them off, but they leave you wounded."
event_road_campaign_2_intro,"You are feeling a tad hungry as you walk down the road. You are considering stopping for a meal when you come across a thicket of bushes covered in green berries. 

The berries look delicious, but you hesitate. They could be poisonous. "
event_road_campaign_2_option_a,Eat the berries. 
event_road_campaign_2_option_b,Pass by the berries and just eat your normal rations. 
event_road_campaign_2_result_a,You shrug and grab a handful of berries to stuff in your mouth. They are incredibly sweet and just the right amount of tart. You couldn't feel better about your decision. 
event_road_campaign_2_result_b,"Not wanting to regret making a stupid decision, you refrain from eating the berries and continue on down the road. "
event_road_campaign_30_intro,"You see smoke on the horizon and catch the vague stench of burning flesh. You hasten your step to see what catastrophe lies ahead of you on the road.

After a few minutes, you come upon a trade caravan, ravaged by a pack of Vermlings, if the tracks in the mud are any indication.


Dead bodies and broken, upturned carts lie across the path, but you can also see a few survivors, wounded and bloody, on the ground. A woman limps across the road, carrying pieces of wreckage."
event_road_campaign_30_option_a,Help the survivors deal with the carnage. 
event_road_campaign_30_option_b,Finish the job the Vermlings started and loot whatever is left. 
event_road_campaign_30_result_a_a,"You approach to help those still alive, but the woman in the road screams, gesturing at the Vermling in your group. You try to calm her, but it is of no use. You abandon the cause."
event_road_campaign_30_result_a_b,"You disperse through the scene, tending to people’s wounds and getting them back on their feet. It takes a few supplies, but they seem grateful in the end."
event_road_campaign_30_result_b,"It takes very little effort to finish off those who survived and put them out of their misery. Unfortunately, the Vermlings were quite thorough in their raid. You only manage to find a handful of goods, with the rest presumably either taken or burned."
event_road_campaign_31_intro,"You approach the crest of a hill to the sound of yelling and swords clashing. Advancing, you see a trade caravan fighting off a swarm of Vermlings.

You can easily see that the caravan guards are not doing well. They are vastly outnumbered and forced to remain in a defensive position to protect their employers. You expect they will be overwhelmed and killed in a manner of minutes."
event_road_campaign_31_option_a,Charge into the fray to protect the caravan from a savage attack.
event_road_campaign_31_option_b,Watch for a while and wait for an opportune moment to strike. 
event_road_campaign_31_result_a_a,"Fortunately, some of your group excels when in a defensive position, and the tide of the battle clearly turns once they take
command of the situation. The Vermlings are driven off and the caravan is saved."
event_road_campaign_31_result_a_b,"You try to save the guards, but end up in their same predicament. You manage to fight off the Vermlings, but not before all the guards and merchants are killed."
event_road_campaign_31_result_b,"You wait for a good long while, until after the guards have all been slaughtered and the Vermlings are softened up a bit. They’re going through the goods in the wagons when
you hit them with a surprise attack. Caught off guard, they go down without much of a fight."
event_road_campaign_32_intro,"You encounter two Valraths with a small horse and cart on the side of the road. They seem a little uncomfortable at your approach, their hands instinctively going for their weapons.

You make a sign of peace and they relax a little.

“Perhaps it is good that you happen by, travelers,” the one on the left says. “Our horse is completely spent and we fare little better. We are in desperate need of some supplies to finish our journey.”

The Valrath offers a crude smile. “Do you think you could help us in this matter?”"
event_road_campaign_32_option_a,Give the Valraths a portion of your supplies.
event_road_campaign_32_option_b,You spent good money on these supplies. Refuse to help. 
event_road_campaign_32_result_a_a,The Quartermaster steps forward with a smile and hands over a sack of food and gear. He is always well-stocked and the Valraths are grateful for the aid.
event_road_campaign_32_result_a_b,"You’ll need to replace the supplies the next time you’re in town, but you decide you can spare them. The Valraths thank you with relief."
event_road_campaign_32_result_b,"You apologize curtly and continue on your way. The Valraths seem disappointed, but vaguely understanding. It doesn’t stop them from whispering things about you to each other as you walk away."
event_road_campaign_33_intro,"Something is...off.

You stop in the middle of the road and feel a rippling in your skin. You’re not sure what it is, but some strange forces are at work.

There is a faint whisper on the wind, and you feel as though at any moment, one step could send you plummeting off the face of the earth."
event_road_campaign_33_option_a,Investigate further. Whatever forces are at work must be put in check. 
event_road_campaign_33_option_b,Get out of this place as quickly as you can. 
event_road_campaign_33_result_a_a,"The Aesther in your group leads you to an area off the road that feels...fuzzy. It is hard to focus your vision, as if the space in front of you is only half there. With a few words from the Aesther, the blur is gone."
event_road_campaign_33_result_a_b,"You wander around for a while before a massive demon suddenly appears before you, ripped from another plane. Your presence surprises it, though, and you dispatch it before too much trouble is caused."
event_road_campaign_33_result_b,"You head forward with all haste, eager to get back your bearings. You seem to be out of the worst of it when you are suddenly ambushed by a giant demon from behind. You fight it
off, but not before it tears into you and burns your flesh."
event_road_campaign_34_intro,"Your travels leave you out in the wilderness overnight, so you make camp and start a fire.

It’s hard to sleep outside of the comfort of the city, always on guard, looking for the next fatal threat. Luckily the night proves fairly dull. That is, until you hear the sound of voices approaching your camp.

They are faint and low—almost like growling, but you can hear indications of language."
event_road_campaign_34_option_a,Quickly put out the fire and sneak out into the brush to get a look.
event_road_campaign_34_option_b,Wait by the fire for whatever comes. 
event_road_campaign_34_result_a_a,Your stealth skills prove sufficient enough to remain unnoticed by a large group of Inox. You decide to let them pass by without incident.
event_road_campaign_34_result_a_b,"You attempt to hide and stay quiet, but a snapped twig at an unfortunate moment startles the passing band of Inox, and they pull out weapons and attack. The scene turns bloody, and you are barely able to fight them off."
event_road_campaign_34_result_b_a,"A group of Inox appears at the edge of your campsite. Seeing their kind among you, they greet you in a friendly manner and
stay for some time to talk. After they leave, you find the remainder of the night restful."
event_road_campaign_34_result_b_b,A group of irate Inox appears at the edge of your campsite. They claim you are trespassing and force you to pack up and leave. You walk through the rest of the night and arrive at your destination tired.
event_road_campaign_35_intro,"You are enjoying a pleasant, peaceful stroll down the road when you find yourself suddenly surrounded by a beleaguered group of men. One of them steps forward, a pox covering half his face.

“Good day to you.” He smiles weakly. “We hate to be a burden, but you see, my camp has been taken ill with a strange malady, and we must kindly beg you for some money for medicine.”

You look around to see that some disfiguring disease has indeed come over the lot of them.

The man scratches the side of his face with one hand while he slowly pulls out a sword with the other. “I’m afraid we can’t take no for an answer.”"
event_road_campaign_35_option_a,"Fight off the men. This is highway robbery, whatever the motive."
event_road_campaign_35_option_b,Pay the men and be on your away. 
event_road_campaign_35_result_a_a,"The Plagueherald stretches out his arms and the men around him immediately double over in pain. You can almost sense it smiling, even though it doesn’t have a face. The fight doesn’t last long, especially once the men’s wounds start bursting with maggots."
event_road_campaign_35_result_a_b,"The men are weakened, but they are still hardened fighters. You fight them off, but it gets ugly."
event_road_campaign_35_result_b_a,"You smile as nonthreateningly as you can and reach for your coin purse. You try to give them just a couple coins, but he encourages you to donate more. Eventually the men seem satisfied and move on their way."
event_road_campaign_35_result_b_b,"When you try to pay with what
few coins you have, the man thinks you are
holding out on him and grows angry."
event_road_campaign_36_intro,"Up ahead, you see the path you are on leads into a dark and unfamiliar wood. It gives you an eerie feeling.

As you step closer, you can feel your skin crawl and it forces you to pause. You can’t help but think that this wood might best be avoided."
event_road_campaign_36_option_a,Continue down the path into the wood. You are not afraid. 
event_road_campaign_36_option_b,Find another way to your destination. 
event_road_campaign_36_result_a_a,"The wood is overgrown and rampant with all manner of insects, but with difficulty, you follow the path. Somewhere deep inside, you come across a stone pedestal with the following scratched into its base:
[Insert Runes Here]"
event_road_campaign_36_result_a_b,You follow the path into the wood and become hopelessly lost. The going is hard and painful.
event_road_campaign_36_result_b,"The wood is large and you spend a little more time than you’d like trying to get around it. With enough effort, you arrive at your destination just a little bit more tired than you’d like."
event_road_campaign_37_intro,"What starts as a light rain quickly turns into something much
worse, with torrents of water battering your skin and lightning piercing the sky.

You’re able to find a small rock outcropping and rush under it as thunder shakes the ground. This should protect you from the worst of it, but you don’t know how long the storm will last."
event_road_campaign_37_option_a,Brave the storm and continue on your way. It's not that bad.
event_road_campaign_37_option_b,Wait out the storm under the outcropping. 
event_road_campaign_37_result_a_a,"You feel positively dismal trudging through the mud and the rain, until you hear the Soothsinger’s voice rise above the thunder. She’s singing a song in the middle of the storm, and everyone starts to feel better."
event_road_campaign_37_result_a_b,"Walking down the road in a storm is just awful. You are wet and cold and miserable and you cannot wait for the whole
experience to end. By the time you reach your destination, you are not feeling well at all."
event_road_campaign_37_result_b,"It is far from ideal, but the outcropping keeps you mostly dry and protects you from the howling wind. You wait hours and hours, huddled up under the rock until the storm passes. By the time you arrive at your destination, you are a bit slow on your feet due to lack of sleep."
event_road_campaign_38_intro,"It is something small that catches your eye: a button on the ground, glinting in the sun. A button in the shape of an Oak Leaf.

You stop to investigate, and then you begin to see the bigger things. Splatters of blood in the dirt. Signs of multiple bodies being dragged into the forest.

You stand and peer into the underbrush. You see a few broken branches and crushed plants. Maybe you could track the bodies through the forest."
event_road_campaign_38_option_a,Head off into the forest to find out what happened. 
event_road_campaign_38_option_b,Move on. That forest does not look friendly. 
event_road_campaign_38_result_a_a,"You are able to track the trail with ease. It leads to a couple of priests, bloody and unconscious, but still alive. You revive them and bring them back to the main road. They are very grateful."
event_road_campaign_38_result_a_b,"You try to follow the trail, but end up getting turned around and lost. Then you have an incredibly difficult and painful time just finding your way back out."
event_road_campaign_38_result_b,"Whatever happened here could not have been good, but also it doesn’t concern you and you’re not about to head into that dark, dense forest ill-prepared. You find it best to move along and attend to your own matters."
event_road_campaign_39_intro,"You see movement in the tall grass to your left, and a weak voice calls out.

“Help...me...please...”

You approach the stirring to see a Valrath man writhing on the ground, his skin covered in boils and pus-filled sores.

“The sickness burns...” he moans at you. “Please...help...”"
event_road_campaign_39_option_a,Help the poor Valrath.
event_road_campaign_39_option_b,This is clearly some sort of plague. Avoid it at all costs. 
event_road_campaign_39_result_a_a,"The Sawbones knows exactly what to do, covering his hands and face as he cleans the wounds. After an hour of tending to him, the Valrath seems good enough to travel."
event_road_campaign_39_result_a_b,"You help the Valrath as best you can, but it takes many supplies and potions. When he finally looks better, you realize you are starting to feel sick as a result."
event_road_campaign_39_result_b,"You recoil in terror and quickly move along. You can hear the Valrath sobbing as you do so, but you know well enough to avoid a plague when you see it."
event_road_campaign_3_intro,"You are feeling a tad hungry as you walk down the road. You are considering stopping for a meal when you come across a thicket of bushes covered in red berries. 

The berries look delicious, but you hesitate. They could be poisonous. "
event_road_campaign_3_option_a,Eat the berries. 
event_road_campaign_3_option_b,Pass by the berries and just eat your normal rations. 
event_road_campaign_3_result_a,"You shrug and grab a handful of berries to stuff in your mouth. They are incredibly sweet and just the right amount of tart. You couldn't feel better about your decision. That is, until you start vomiting. Your stomach is incredibly unhappy with you, and the situation doesn't improve much by the time you arrive at your destination. "
event_road_campaign_3_result_b,"Not wanting to regret making a stupid decision, you refrain from eating the berries and continue on down the road. "
event_road_campaign_40_intro,"There were heavy rains last night for sure, but you didn’t realize the full extent of it until you come face-to-face with a river raging right through the middle of the road. This river is no small matter, either—it is several feet deep and fast-flowing. It’s rather troubling, too, since you have no idea how long it might take to find a decent crossing point."
event_road_campaign_40_option_a,"Ford the river where you are. It is not ideal, but it should be possible. "
event_road_campaign_40_option_b,Head downriver and find a better place to cross. 
event_road_campaign_40_result_a_a,"With the power of the elements on your side, crossing the river turns out to be incredibly easy. One frozen bridge later, you are on the other side and on your way."
event_road_campaign_40_result_a_b,"The water is surprisingly cold, but it will take more than that to end your day. You are still water-logged and shivering when you reach your destination, however."
event_road_campaign_40_result_b,"It takes an hour, but you finally find a rocky area where the river has been diverted into many smaller streams. It is no problem to cross, but just finding the spot and then getting back on track takes some of the fire out of you."
event_road_campaign_41_intro,"Your path is taking you through a small wooded area when you suddenly see a large bear charging directly at you through the trees.

You may have gotten too close to its den, but you can’t know for sure. All you know is that it is clearly enraged, and you have very little time to react."
event_road_campaign_41_option_a,Attempt to calm the bear and back away slowly. 
event_road_campaign_41_option_b,Arm yourself and fight off the bear. 
event_road_campaign_41_result_a_a,The Beast Tyrant steps forward with his hand outstretched and makes a low humming sound. The bear stops mid-charge with a perplexed look. You leave the animal there and continue on your way unharmed.
event_road_campaign_41_result_a_b,"Two seconds later, you can’t help but feel this was a terrible idea. The bear wounds you severely before you are able to arm yourself and fight it off."
event_road_campaign_41_result_b,"You quickly grab your weapons as the bear comes down on you. The fight is brutal and ugly, but it could have been much worse."
event_road_campaign_42_intro,"A trade caravan passes by you on the road. This event isn’t too uncommon, but what catches your eye is a familiar-looking Inox traveling with the caravan as a guard.

At the sight of you, the Brute lights up and gives you a big wave, then rushes over to greet you. He is positively joyful to see you and immediately starts to reminisce about all the exciting battles you fought together.

Slapping you on the back, he implores you to travel with the caravan for a while to give you all a chance to catch up."
event_road_campaign_42_option_a,Agree to travel with the Brute for a little while. So what if it’s in the wrong direction?
event_road_campaign_42_option_b,Regretfully leave the Brute to his duties and continue on your way.
event_road_campaign_42_result_a,"As you walk with the Brute and talk with him about your early adventuring days, you find a hint of sadness behind his enthusiasm. He explains how he fell on hard times after leaving the group and had to resort to jobs like this to make ends meet. The Brute seems uplifted by your conversation, but the day grows late. By the time you head back and arrive at your destination, you are incredibly tired."
event_road_campaign_42_result_b,"You explain to the Brute that you have a long day’s travel ahead of you and cannot take the time to travel in the other direction. As you make your good-byes, a shadow falls over
him. He walks away forlorn."
event_road_campaign_43_intro,"You probably wouldn’t have normally noticed it, but sometimes
nature calls and you need to head off the beaten path to get some privacy.

Hidden in the bushes, you come across the smoking wreckage of some crude machine. It looks to have broken down at some point and was left here to rust and decay.

Most of it is scrap, but thanks to your time with the Tinkerer, you know a good power core when you see one. It’s a bit heavier than you’d hoped, but it should fetch a good price back in Gloomhaven."
event_road_campaign_43_option_a,Take the core with you. 
event_road_campaign_43_option_b,Leave the core alone. You don't want anything weighing you down in battle.  
event_road_campaign_43_result_a,"The core sure is heavy. You manage it rather well, but it will be a bit of hindrance in battle. You hope the payoff is worth the trouble."
event_road_campaign_43_result_b,You decide the risk is not worth the reward and walk away from the contraption before you scratch yourself on the rusted metal and give yourself some foul disease. And just the thought of haggling with the Quatryls in the Mixed District about a fair price makes you tired and irritable.
event_road_campaign_44_intro,"Due to a late start, night falls before you can get to where you are going. You are on your guard throughout the night, but nothing can quite prepare you for a Night Demon attack.

They come upon you silent and invisible, so you are unaware of their presence until their claws sink into your flesh.

The darkness erupts into chaos with flashing swords and horrific shrieks. And then a bolt of fire streaks through the darkness and incinerates one of the demons.

Someone else is out there."
event_road_campaign_44_option_a,Renew your efforts to slay the demons.
event_road_campaign_44_option_b,Use the distraction to disengage from the demons and run away. 
event_road_campaign_44_result_a,"With the help of the mysterious firecaster, the battle turns and the demons are slain without much pain. Out of the darkness steps the familiar face of a female Orchid.

“Sorry about that. I think they were looking for this.” The Spellweaver holds up a black censer. “It’s a good thing I ran into you, though. I could use your help.”

She draws out a crude map. “Meet me here as soon as you can, and I’ll explain more.”"
event_road_campaign_44_result_b,"This mysterious third party seems to have things under control, and the demons appear more interested in them anyway. You take the opportunity to retreat from the fight and run off into the night. You don’t feel great about it, but at least you’re alive."
event_road_campaign_45_intro,"Riding up on horses, a band of dirty, rough men quickly overtake and surround your group. They look hard and
dangerous, and you immediately pull out your weapons as they approach.

Then you hear a familiar laugh.

“Well, if it isn’t my old crew.” A woman in dark leather armor leaps off her horse to comes greet you. “You know what, boys? This lot gets a pass.”

She winks at you and turns around. “Plus, they’d probably kill you all if things turned ugly.”

Jumping back onto her horse, the Scoundrel looks back at you. “Well, it was nice seeing you. Just remember—you never saw me.”"
event_road_campaign_45_option_a,"Attack. Friend or not, those who prey on the weak should be brought to justice."
event_road_campaign_45_option_b,Let the bandits go. 
event_road_campaign_45_result_a,"You see the bandits relax a little and begin to form up. That is when you strike. Some are scared off by the sudden attack, but others engage you hungrily. The Scoundrel throws a few good daggers, too, before she rides off, criticizing your poor decision-making."
event_road_campaign_45_result_b,The bandits seem a little disappointed as they form up and ride off in the opposite direction.
event_road_campaign_46_intro,"Walking among the foothills, you see a steep ridge in front of you, and on top of it, a very odd rock formation.

The formation calls to you somehow, but the way up is not readily apparent. In fact, climbing the ridge looks pretty dangerous, but you just feel like you need to get up there and look at the rocks."
event_road_campaign_46_option_a,Take the risk to climb to the ridge and investigate the rocks.
event_road_campaign_46_option_b,Forget about the rocks and continue on your journey. 
event_road_campaign_46_result_a,"Fearing the possibility of falling from a great height, you choose your steps carefully. Still, the climb to the top takes a long time and is exhausting. Reaching the top, you approach
the unnatural rock formation, a giant mound of stones stacked one on top of another. At the base of the bottom stone, you see the following etched with charcoal:
[Insert runes here]"
event_road_campaign_46_result_b,"You shake your head and move past the ridge. You have more important things to do than climb rocks. Still, you feel the pull of the site, even after it fades from view. You get the feeling that this won’t be the last time you see it."
event_road_campaign_47_intro,"A single Vermling jumps out of the brush at you, surprising you
briefly. Within moments, though, you have your weapons out and pressed against his throat.

“EEEEEEEeeeahh!” The Vermling drops his weapon and cowers. “No attack! My brothers in the bushes say you had stink of city-dwelling outcast on you. I wanted to be sure.”

The Vermling waves his hands. “It’s not bad! Just curious. Being stinky city-dwelling outcast is fine. Please, don’t hurt me!”"
event_road_campaign_47_option_a,"Move on, leave the strange Vermling in peace. "
event_road_campaign_47_option_b,Kill the savage little beast. 
event_road_campaign_47_result_a,"“Stink very faint,” the Vermling continues as you walk on. “Outcast no longer with you,
but I still smell it!”

He then jumps back into the brush. Vermlings are very odd creatures."
event_road_campaign_47_result_b,"You attack the Vermling anyway, despite his protests. It turns out he wasn’t lying about his “brothers” nearby, though. As you
wipe the blood from your blade, ten more of the little furry creatures jump out at you, brandishing small knives. They are not nearly as easy to dispatch."
event_road_campaign_48_intro,"You see them long before they get close to you—radiant balls of light blazing against the horizon.

Sun Demons.

As they approach, you prepare for an attack, but the demons have other plans. They menace you with their glowing claws, but they would rather have information than kill you.

“Where is the one you call a Sunkeeper?” one of them hisses. “The Valrath neglects her duties, and now we must resolve matters personally.”

You press for further information, but the demons get angry. “These are not your concerns! Tell us where she is or die at our hands!”"
event_road_campaign_48_option_a,Give them whatever information you can on the Sunkeeper’s whereabouts.
event_road_campaign_48_option_b,"Attack the demons. There are a lot of them, but you do not take kindly to threats. "
event_road_campaign_48_result_a,"You’re not sure exactly what happened to the Sunkeeper after she left the party, but you tell the demons everything you know.
They seem satisfied with your response and even offer a bitter thanks as they fly off to the west."
event_road_campaign_48_result_b,"Without even speaking, you draw your weapons and attack. The demons are caught off guard, but they bounce back with great ferocity. It is a long, brutal battle, and you continue on in your adventure greatly wounded and bloody."
event_road_campaign_49_intro,"You are approached on the road by a group of men on horseback. They don’t immediately seem menacing, but they are formidable and well organized.

One of the men, who wears plate armor and has a sword at his side, addresses you coldly. “You hail from Gloomhaven, correct? What say you about the politics of the place? Are you for or against military rule in the region? Do you think those fool merchants could do a better job, like they’re doing
with the rest of this doomed land?”

Looking closer, you see all the men wear the signet of a tower with an eye at its center."
event_road_campaign_49_option_a,Claim allegiance to the military.
event_road_campaign_49_option_b,Claim allegiance to the merchant guilds. 
event_road_campaign_49_result_a,"The armored men seem satisfied with your response and take their hands off their weapons.

“Good to find some fellow patriots,” the one in front says with a disturbing smile. “You know, we have a stronghold not far from here up in the mountains. Feel free to visit there if you ever get serious about your loyalties.”"
event_road_campaign_49_result_b,"“Well then, today’s your unlucky day,” the man in front says. “Because we of the Vigil make it a point to execute any and all
commerce sympathizers we can find in this land.”

The men grimly draw swords and advance. After a hard battle, the survivors retreat, leaving you to pick through the corpses. Among the loot you find a map."
event_road_campaign_4_intro,"You see fresh wagon tracks in the dirt as you walk along the road. You continue forward and begin to pick out a number of distinct tracks. They must be from a large caravan. 

Sure enough, as you crest a hill. you see a group of four wagons headed down the road in the same direction as you. You count perhaps three or four guards among them."
event_road_campaign_4_option_a,Approach the caravan and offer to travel with them until your paths diverge. 
event_road_campaign_4_option_b,Attack the caravan. 
event_road_campaign_4_result_a,"The merchants in the caravan seem grateful, though the guards eye you skeptically. 
After traveling for half a day without event, you head off down a side road and wave good-bye. The merchants express their appreciation with a bit of coin. "
event_road_campaign_4_result_b,"With so few guards protecting it, the caravan makes an ideal mark, You charge down the hill, weapons at the ready. The merchants scatter, and the guards are easily dispatched, leaving you with a nice stash of valuables. "
event_road_campaign_50_intro,"Up ahead of you, you see a staff stuck in the very center of the road, pointing straight up out of the ground. You get closer, and an odd sense of foreboding comes over you.

You recognize the staff as the one wielded by the Summoner. The fact that it now in front of you with such a strange and ominous placement makes you very wary.

You quickly look around, but nothing else of note is in sight."
event_road_campaign_50_option_a,Take the staff and move on. 
event_road_campaign_50_option_b,Investigate the area and get to the bottom of this. 
event_road_campaign_50_result_a,"You shrug and grab the staff, half expecting something exciting to happen when you do. Instead, nothing happens at all. In fact, the staff seems rather mundane. You feel no power running through it at all. Still, no sense in leaving it behind. It could be important."
event_road_campaign_50_result_b,"You spend a good hour looking over the area, scouring every bush and divot you can find. Unfortunately, you find no other clues about what happened here and end up just tiring yourself out."
event_road_campaign_51_intro,"You reach a crossroads and decide to rest for a bit. As you eat some of your rations, something sticking up out of the ground in the distance catches your attention.

You move closer, and what you thought was a signpost turns out to be a human skull impaled on a spike.

There is something sticking out of the skull’s mouth."
event_road_campaign_51_option_a,Investigate further. 
event_road_campaign_51_option_b,Arm yourself and make a defensive retreat from the area. 
event_road_campaign_51_result_a,"You get closer to the pike. The skull looks pretty fresh. There are still bits of decayed flesh attached to the bone, and flies buzz around it. You can see there is a small paper card stuck in its mouth, so you carefully reach in and pull it out. The card is black and depicts a skull with blades running through it. Come to think of it, you remember rumors of an assassins’ guild that has been known to use the same imagery. You get out of the area as quickly as you can."
event_road_campaign_51_result_b,"You remember rumors of an assassins’ guild that places a skull on a pike outside the houses of their victims before they strike. Fearing the worst, you pull out your weapons and survey the scene as you back away from the pike. Everything looks clear, so you quickly get as far away from the area as possible. Perhaps the skull was not meant for you."
event_road_campaign_52_intro,"You smell the corpses before you see them. A group of five or so, spread across the road, flies buzzing around in a frenzy.

As you get closer, you see the wretched, deformed looks on their faces and the boils covering their skin. You also see their crude armor and weapons—likely a group of cutthroats.

What is truly odd, though, is that their weapons are out of their sheaths in the first place. It appears they were engaged in battle when they suddenly succumbed to some horrible disease.

You can think of at least one way that could have happened. Fine handiwork from the Plagueherald."
event_road_campaign_52_option_a,Leave the corpses alone. 
event_road_campaign_52_option_b,Inspect the corpses for valuables. 
event_road_campaign_52_result_a,"Knowing better than to get too close to the machinations of the Plagueherald, you keep a wide berth between you and the corpses and continue down the road."
event_road_campaign_52_result_b,"You rifle through the corpses, grabbing stray coins and valuables as you go. You make off with a good haul, but you start feeling sick as soon as you’re done."
event_road_campaign_53_intro,"You hear the distinctive sound of metal-on-metal in the distance and race up a hill in the road to investigate.

In front of you, you see a familiar female Inox in heated battle with a group of Gloomhaven guards. Though outnumbered and bloodied, you’ve never seen that stop the Berserker before. With every wound they inflict, she becomes more and more
enraged, cleaving off limbs with the ease of cutting grass."
event_road_campaign_53_option_a,Help the Berserker fight off the guards. 
event_road_campaign_53_option_b,Wait and see what happens. It looks like she's handling herself well enough. 
event_road_campaign_53_result_a,"You enter the battle to aid the Berserker, but in her blood rage, she can’t distinguish friend from foe. She begins hacking away at you with her axe as much as she swings at the guards. You concentrate on taking out the remaining guards, but when you turn back to the Berserker, she seems to have vanished into the nearby forest."
event_road_campaign_53_result_b,"After a brutal and bloody fight, only the Berserker remains standing. After her blood rage subsides, she collapses from exhaustion. You race to her side and attempt to revive her using a number of powerful potions. She finally awakes and expresses her begrudging gratitude. You ask about the fight, but she just shakes her head. She offers her axe as thanks and then dashes off into the forest."
event_road_campaign_54_intro,"Deep inside a dense forest, you begin to hear the jangling of bells and see a small troupe of performers approaching you through the trees.

“Well, look who it is!” The small voice belongs to a garishly dressed female Quatryl with a lute and a feathered hat. “Fancy running into you out here.” 

“This actually may be a stroke of luck,” the Soothsinger says. “You see, my compatriots and I seem to be a bit lost. We were headed toward the Capital when my drummer said he knew a shortcut. Now here we are in the middle of a forest without an inkling of a clue. I don’t suppose you could find it in your heart to escort us back to the main road, could you?"""
event_road_campaign_54_option_a,Take the time to escort the troupe back out of the forest. 
event_road_campaign_54_option_b,Give detailed directions about the way out and hope that is sufficient.
event_road_campaign_54_result_a,"While escorting the Soothsinger and her troupe out of the forest, you are able to catch up a bit. She is very happy now as a traveling performer, playing to sold-out concerts across the land. When you reach the main road, you say your good-byes and then make the long trek back to where you were going."
event_road_campaign_54_result_b_a,You gauge your bearings and then give precise directions on the easiest way out of the forest and back to the main road. The Soothsinger seems impressed and waves good-bye as she heads off.
event_road_campaign_54_result_b_b,You hem and haw and then give some vague directions back to the road. The Soothsinger looks at you skeptically and heads off.
event_road_campaign_55_intro,"You come to a fork in the road. One path looks clear and easy, but the other path is overgrown with thorns and nettles. Either one will likely get you to where you are going.

The whole situation feels off, though—as if someone
or something is watching you.

Still, a decision must be made."
event_road_campaign_55_option_a,Take the clear path.
event_road_campaign_55_option_b,Take the overgrown path.
event_road_campaign_55_result_a,"You walk down the clear path for a few minutes, and, just when you think the whole weird feeling was your imagination, a group of human bandits jumps out at you from the nearby brush. Before they can engage, however, an arrow suddenly spears the chest of the closest bandit, followed very quickly by a second. The bandits have paused to look around in panic when a third arrow flies into another bandit’s skull. The bandits scatter and run off. You look around for the shooter, but no trace is found."
event_road_campaign_55_result_b,"The trek through the overgrown path is unpleasant. You are constantly getting pricked by sharp thorns covered in a strange
sap. You think you recognize them from a previous foray into harsh, unforgiving foliage. Sure enough, you start feeling sick pretty soon after you emerge from the bushes."
event_road_campaign_56_intro,"At first the man looks dead, with numerous open wounds and lying in a pool of blood in the dirt.

But then he coughs and whispers something unintelligible. The man looks pretty bad off, likely attacked by some wild animal, but it’s possible he could be saved."
event_road_campaign_56_option_a,Help the wounded man as best you can.
event_road_campaign_56_option_b,Let the man die and take his belongings. 
event_road_campaign_56_result_a,"The man’s wounds actually look worse than they really are, and your time with the Sawbones has given you some experience in what to do. You bind the wounds to stop the bleeding and then give him something to eat. He lost a lot of blood, but after some nursing, he’s able to stand and make his way back to Gloomhaven, thanking you profusely in the process."
event_road_campaign_56_result_b,"You riffle through the man’s pockets as he speaks his last words. They’re too soft to make out, but the tone is one of anger and disappointment. You make off with a decent amount of money and leave the corpse to rot."
event_road_campaign_57_intro,"You are wandering through an abysmal fog, cursing the very fact you woke up this morning. You can’t see two feet in front of your face and everything is just so cold and damp.

Walking down what you think is the road, you nearly bump into an elderly Savvas.

“Ah, how fortuitous is such a meeting,” the Savvas
says. “You look like the ones whom my protégé worked with for some time. Normally I would not give the lesser races a second glance, but the master of elements must have seen something in you.”

It stretches its joints and looks around. “Hmm, you must be having a rough time with this weather. I could offer you something that may help.”"
event_road_campaign_57_option_a,Accept the gift of the Savvas. 
event_road_campaign_57_option_b,Downplay your struggle and politely decline the Savvas's offer. 
event_road_campaign_57_result_a,"The Savvas concentrates and lays its hand on you. You suddenly feel very warm and all the fog within ten feet of you dissipates.

“There you go. That should make things easier. The effect should last for at least as long as the fog does. Have a pleasant day!”"
event_road_campaign_57_result_b,"“Ah, I see,” the Savvas says. “You’d rather grow from an experience than take the easy way out. A noble path.”

The Savvas slaps you on the back. “Well, get to it, then! It’s just fog after all. You’ll survive."""
event_road_campaign_58_intro,"Despite your best efforts, you find yourself lost in a forest. You thought you were taking a shortcut, but then you got turned around and lost your bearings.

And just when you think things couldn’t get worse, a wolf suddenly jumps out of the brush in front of you. Oddly, though, it doesn’t appear aggressive. 

It howls once and then slowly and deliberately begins to walk through the trees in front of you, as if expecting you to follow it."
event_road_campaign_58_option_a,Follow the wolf.
event_road_campaign_58_option_b,Find your own way through the forest. 
event_road_campaign_58_result_a,"Miraculously, following the wolf leads you right to the edge of the forest and back on track to your destination. The wolf howls once more and then bounds off back into the brush. You can’t help but wonder who might have sent that wolf to assist you."
event_road_campaign_58_result_b,"Not willing to trust a wild animal, you refuse to go in the same direction as the wolf and continue down an ill-fated path of your own choosing. It doesn’t go well, and by the time you emerge from the dense forest and find your bearings, you are exhausted."
event_road_campaign_59_intro,"The air is especially humid and muggy as you walk towards your destination, but even that couldn’t explain the
sight that greets you on the road.

Directly in front of you, completely blocking the only available path, is a massive swarm of insects. There must be millions of them.

You take a hesitant step forward and the bugs do not react. They are not concerned by your presence at all."
event_road_campaign_59_option_a,Cover yourself as best you can and try to walk through the swarm.
event_road_campaign_59_option_b,Use whatever you can to burn a path through the swarm. 
event_road_campaign_59_result_a,"If you were to list the top ten worst moments of your life, this would probably be up there. You walk into the swarm and the insects are everywhere, biting and clawing at your flesh. You move as quickly as you can, emerging from the other side with your life intact but your sanity in shambles. Oddly, though, you also feel as though you were just in the presence of a powerful, divine force."
event_road_campaign_59_result_b,"It takes a monumental effort, but you are eventually able to disperse the cloud of insects enough to run through to the other side. As you do so, however, you hear an odd voice among the buzzing, cursing you for your violent actions."
event_road_campaign_5_intro,"You are traveling through a small wooded area when you round a bend and find a group of Inox warriors fighting a band of armored humans. 

With all the commotion, it's hard to discern more details, but the humans look like guards from Gloomhaven. You are not sure why they would be out here fighting the Inox, though. "
event_road_campaign_5_option_a,Help the Inox fight off the humans. 
event_road_campaign_5_option_b,Help the humans fight off the Inox. 
event_road_campaign_5_result_a,"Fearing the battle could go either way, you charge into the fray, laying low the human attackers. When the dust settles, the Inox offer you a skeptical thanks. 

""Humans think they own all this land,"" one of the Inox says as he spits on the ground. ""We thank you for helping us with the nuisance. Allow us to bless you with a gift."""
event_road_campaign_5_result_b,"With your arrival, the Inox retreat back into the woods, one of them casting hexes as he flees. 

""Blast it all,"" one of the guards says. ""Patrol duty is the absolute worst. No matter what we tell those savages, they're convinced we're going to take over their forest. Anyway, thanks for your help. I thought we were done for."""
event_road_campaign_60_intro,"You see smoke on the horizon and sigh, expecting the worst. Sure enough, you approach the scene to find a ransacked caravan—burned, pillaged, and destroyed by what appears to be Vermlings.

You find one survivor among the victims who laments that when the Vermlings came upon them, one of the guards, a large Inox, seemed to throw aside his weapon and simply accept his fate.

That’s when you find the body of the Brute, torn and bloody among the wreckage. Seeing him this way, the fire gone from his eyes, he appears unnaturally small."
event_road_campaign_60_option_a,Respectfully bury the dead and mourn their loss.
event_road_campaign_60_option_b,Take what you can find and move on. 
event_road_campaign_60_result_a,"Though you didn’t take the time to talk with the Brute earlier, now you take the time to bury his corpse and say a few words about his strength of body and character. The survivor thanks you for your help, and you continue on your way once more."
event_road_campaign_60_result_b,"Near the corpse of the Brute, you find an axe, presumably the weapon he threw away. There’s really nothing else among the debris, so you wordlessly pick it up and move on."
event_road_campaign_61_intro,"You are heading through a small forest when you hear the sound of a woman screaming off to the west. You silently move closer, catching a glimpse of multiple radiant figures through the trees.

They are Sun Demons, perhaps the same ones who accosted you earlier. That suspicion is confirmed when you get closer and see they are hovering around an armored Valrath woman bound to a tree, torturing her for information.

“Don’t you see how important this is!” one of the demons says. “Give us the location of the temple!”

“Lies and tricks of a demon,” the Sunkeeper responds. “The temple is in no danger except from you.”"
event_road_campaign_61_option_a,Leave the scene quietly and return to your own business. 
event_road_campaign_61_option_b,Attack the demons and free the Sunkeeper. 
event_road_campaign_61_result_a,"Not wanting to get involved, you simply move on. Eventually the screams of the Sunkeeper fade away."
event_road_campaign_61_result_b,"You charge out of the trees and attack the Sun Demons. Fueled by righteous indignation and a bit of guilt, you slay them all. The battle leaves you wounded, but the Sunkeeper
happily mends your wounds once you free her.

“They seemed to think the Sun Temple is under attack by Night Demons,” she says. “I have no reason to believe them, but still, would you mind helping me look into it?”"
event_road_campaign_62_intro,"By now, the Sun Demons cut a very recognizable portrait against the horizon as they move toward you. You sincerely
had hoped you were done with these creatures.

“We have urgent need of your assistance,” one of them starts. “Night Demons have infested the Sun Temple. attempting to desecrate it and send the world into eternal darkness.

“We have tried to stop them, but they are too fortified inside the temple. We regrettably need more strength.

“Please, you cannot want an absence of a sun on this
plane any less than we do. It would be disastrous.”"
event_road_campaign_62_option_a,Agree to help the Sun Demons. 
event_road_campaign_62_option_b,Attack the Sun Demons. It may be the only way to stop them from bothering you. 
event_road_campaign_62_result_a,"You sigh and agree, warning them that this had better be the last time they ask you for a favor. They give you the location of the Sun Temple and implore you to hurry."
event_road_campaign_62_result_b,"Without even speaking, you draw your weapons and attack. The demons are caught off guard, but they bounce back with great ferocity. It is a long, brutal battle, and you continue on in your adventure greatly wounded and bloody."
event_road_campaign_63_intro,"As you walk through some foothills, the ground suddenly shakes violently beneath you. Two massive demons built of earth and stone rise up in front of you.

“Today we shall feast on your flesh, foolish travelers!”

Just as the demons take a step toward you, a massive ball of fire streaks through the air from behind and connects squarely with one of the demons, which erupts into a pillar of flame. Then lightning streaks toward the other, destroying one of its arms.

Looking around, you see the old Savvas you met earlier, who continues to throw out powerful attacks until the demons are forced to retreat.

“Well, fancy meeting you again!”"
event_road_campaign_63_option_a,Thank the Savvas for his timely assistance.
event_road_campaign_63_option_b,"Admonish the Savvas, claiming you could have handled the demons without his help. "
event_road_campaign_63_result_a,"“More and more demons around these parts these days. Stopping them from attacking travelers is becoming a time-intensive job, but at least it’s fun.”

The Savvas smiles at you and then turns to leave. “Have a pleasant day!”"
event_road_campaign_63_result_b,"The Savvas adopts a look of serious contemplation. “You are right, of course. I presumed to think that a lesser race would
need my help, but I forgot your dedication to growth and learning. I have made a grave mistake and must now beg your forgiveness.”

It holds out a small trinket toward you. “Please, accept this with my apologies.”"
event_road_campaign_64_intro,"You reach a crossroads and decide to rest for a bit. As you eat some of your rations, something sticking up out of the ground in the distance catches your attention.

You move closer, and what you thought was a signpost turns out to be a human skull impaled on a spike.

There is something sticking out of the skull’s mouth."
event_road_campaign_64_option_a,Investigate further. 
event_road_campaign_64_option_b,Arm yourself and make a defensive retreat from the area. 
event_road_campaign_64_result_a,"Against your better judgment, you approach the skull, which looks suspiciously like the Sin-Ra’s calling card. Sure enough, a group of dark-clad warriors appears before you from out of thin air. Wordlessly, they draw their long, curved blades and attack. Caught by surprise, you don’t fare well in the battle. You do fight them off, but in the end, you are severely wounded, exhausted, and demoralized."
event_road_campaign_64_result_b,"Recognizing the pike as a symbol of the Sin-Ra Syndicate, you arm yourself and run from the area. Unfortunately, you don’t make it far before you see a number of black-clad assassins bearing down on you. You move into a defensive position and prepare for battle. The fight is arduous, but in the end, the assassins are dead, and you hope they don’t come back."
event_road_campaign_65_intro,"As you crest a hill, you see a flock of carrion birds scatter to the east. They must have been feasting on something, so you decide to investigate.

After a short walk, you come upon a man’s corpse, badly decayed and mangled, lying in the dirt. His face is a bloody mess, but you do see a distinctive chain around his neck and recall the description the man from the Sleeping Lion gave you of his brother. This is very likely him."
event_road_campaign_65_option_a,Bury the man and bring the chain back to his brother. 
event_road_campaign_65_option_b,Take the chain for yourself and don't tell the brother. 
event_road_campaign_65_result_a,"Not wanting to tell the brother that you left the corpse out in the sun to rot, you take the time to dig a hole and give it a proper burial. 

When you bring the chain back, the brother is understandably distraught, but he thanks you for giving him closure about what
happened."
event_road_campaign_65_result_b,"The birds get the corpse. You get the chain. Everyone wins, except the man from the Sleeping Lion. But he should know better than to trust mercenaries."
event_road_campaign_66_intro,"The first sign of the Inox raiding party was a cloud of dust on the horizon. It was so large, however, there was nowhere to run.

“City-dwelling scum!” one of the Inox in front calls out to you as you approach. “We march now to attack your city and wipe it from the face of this land. What do you say to that?”

Your first thought, as you prepare for a fight, is that they will need a larger army. Before you can strike, though, the sky grows dark. You assume it is a cloud, but then look up to see a giant drake descending on you from above."
event_road_campaign_66_option_a,Take cover.
event_road_campaign_66_option_b,Attack the Inox. 
event_road_campaign_66_result_a,"You jump into a ditch and cover your head just as the Elder Drake glides over the raiding party, breathing a heavy gout of flame into their midst. Those not incinerated scream and flee for their lives. The drake lands in front of you.

“Intrepid adventurers! I hope I was able to offer you some aid against your aggressors. It really was my pleasure after all you have done for me. I hope you find some things of value among the corpses. It is my gift to you.”"
event_road_campaign_66_result_b,"You attack the large group of Inox while they are distracted by giant creature above you. Things suddenly get very hot, however, when the drake begins spitting fire into the melee.
The Inox scatter and you are suffering from severe burns when the Elder Drake lands in front of you.

“My apologies. I was only trying to help.”"
event_road_campaign_67_intro,"Not too far down the main road outside of Gloomhaven, you run across a merchant wagon headed into town.

“Ah, I was afraid for a second you might be bandits!” The merchant says. “But now I see you are mercenaries from the town, correct? Most excellent! I have heard good things about the mercenaries of Gloomhaven. Hard to believe, coming from such a backwater place, but they are true, correct?”"
event_road_campaign_67_option_a,Demonstrate your virtue by offering to escort the merchant back to Gloomhaven.
event_road_campaign_67_option_b,Demonstrate your lack of virtue by robbing the merchant.
event_road_campaign_67_result_a,"“Ah, well...no, I don’t want to be a bother. But, I mean, yes, I can’t pay you, though I’d love the company. It is rather terrifying traveling the East Road by yourself.”

It is a relatively short journey back to town, but the merchant is very grateful. “I am quite impressed, sirs. I’ll be sure to tell everyone back in the capital that Gloomhaven is a safe place to do business.”"
event_road_campaign_67_result_b,"“Well, I just—I mean, I’d never...” the merchant trails off incredulously. “To think there are places in the world where such barbarism still exists. It boggles the mind.

“I’m going to tell everyone back in the Capital what a horrible, backward shrrggggllg...” Blood bubbles up into his mouth as you slit his throat, making it very difficult for him to continue complaining."
event_road_campaign_68_intro,"Not too far down the main road outside of Gloomhaven, you run across a merchant wagon headed into town.

“Oh no...ah, mercenaries, I see,” the merchant stammers as you approach. “Look, ah, I know the reputation of your like around Gloomhaven. Please, just take what you want and move on. I-I don’t want any trouble.”"
event_road_campaign_68_option_a,Take what you want and move on.
event_road_campaign_68_option_b,Calm the merchant and explain that not all mercenaries are bloodthirsty thieves. 
event_road_campaign_68_result_a,"The merchant remains dead silent as you sift through his cart and pull out any valuables. There’s not a whole lot in his wares, but the ease in which you are able to take what he
has makes it all the sweeter.

Once you are finished, you continue on your way and he continues on his."
event_road_campaign_68_result_b,"“Oh, ah, really?” The merchant looks at you incredulously. “Well then, color me embarrassed. I sincerely apologize for my uneducated assumptions. Sometimes you just expect the worst traveling to such backwater locales.

“I’ll be sure to tell everyone I see that not everyone in Gloomhaven is a criminal,” he says as he rides off, tipping his hat to you."
event_road_campaign_69_intro,"Walking along the trail, you are surprised by a group of demons who appear to your left, charging over a hill toward you. Something is off, however. Their pace is slow, and they are significantly smaller than the demons you normally deal with.

Halfway down the hill, the demons pause and take stock of you. Seeing you are far from easy prey, they turn around and begin to retreat."
event_road_campaign_69_option_a,Chase them down quickly and kill them.
event_road_campaign_69_option_b,"Follow them more slowly, attempting to discover where they came from. "
event_road_campaign_69_result_a,"You roar and charge up the hill. The demons are no match for you, either in speed or in strength. You kill them quickly but painfully."
event_road_campaign_69_result_b,"You creep slowly to the crest of the hill, watching as the demons retreat to the south. You follow them, eventually arriving at a weak, fluctuating rift in a small, earthen cave. Having experienced enough planar manipulation in your travels, you are able to mutter a few incantations and close the rift. It takes a lot out of you, but now there is one less way for demons to invade this plane."
event_road_campaign_6_intro,"Stumbling through the woods, you are alarmed to hear the sudden sounds of a large animal rummaging through the underbush. You crouch down, gauging the grunts and growls. 

Through the trees, you see a large bear approaching your location. It has not noticed you yet, but you imagine it will soon. "
event_road_campaign_6_option_a,Take the opportunity to run from the bear before it gets any closer.
event_road_campaign_6_option_b,"Attack the bear, hopefully catching it by surprise. "
event_road_campaign_6_result_a,"You bolt from hiding as fast as you can. Luckily the bear was still a ways off, and it gets bored with the chase before it can catch you. Still, you keep running and running until you can't catch your breath.  "
event_road_campaign_6_result_b,"The bear roars as you approach, making powerful swipes with its claws. Still, with the surprise and the commotion, the bear is not all that committed to the fight. After a bit of back and forth, the animal grunts and runs off into the trees. "
event_road_campaign_7_intro,"Walking along the edge of a forest, you begin to hear strange, unfamiliar sounds coming from beyond the trees. You stop and listen closer. 

There's a rhythm to the sounds, and with that established, you begin to pick out different human voices in the mix. You'd venture to say that the noise vaguely sounds like chanting.  "
event_road_campaign_7_option_a,Head into the forest to investigate the chanting. 
event_road_campaign_7_option_b,Keep moving on down the road. No need to get mixed up in whatever is going on.  
event_road_campaign_7_result_a,"You quietly move through the forest toward the noise. Eventually you come upon a clearing where you see a circle of cultists performing some strange ritual. One of them notices you and shouts to the others. The situation devolves into a bloody battle. You are, of course, victorious, but it saps some of your strength. "
event_road_campaign_7_result_b,"Without a second thought, you get back onto the main road and continue moving toward your destination. "
event_road_campaign_8_intro,"You see a lone man walking toward you on the road. As you meet on the path, he turns to you and begins to speak.

""Oi there. I wouldn't suppose you lot might spare me some coin?"" he asks. ""A lotta coin, actually.""

You look at him quizically as he continues. ""You see, I lead a lotta thieves and bandits in this area and we gotta make sure all the mouths are fed.""

At this, a large number of bandits come out of hiding around you, emerging from the bushes. 

""So about that coin,"" the man says with a smile. ""Five gold per head oughta do it."""
event_road_campaign_8_option_a,Pay the thieves.
event_road_campaign_8_option_b,"Resist the robbery, killing as many thieves as you can. "
event_road_campaign_8_result_a,"You sigh, and hand over what coins you have.

The man maintains his grin. ""Well, thank you kind sirs. It was a pleasure meeting you, and have a pleasant day!""

The bandits move off in one direction as you continue in the other.  "
event_road_campaign_8_result_b,"Unfazed by the ambush, you draw your weapons and attack the bandits in the bushes. The leader tries to withdraw, but you cut him down as well. There are a lot of bandits, but they don't put up too much of a fight. They seem weak and malnourished. You guess the leader wasn't kidding about needing to buy food. "
event_road_campaign_9_intro,"Walking through a stretch of lowlands, you see a man in armor sitting against a large boulder. As you get closer, you see he is bleeding from his side. 

""Ah, what luck,"" he says. ""I got separated from my detail and then had an unfortunate run-in with a bear. I'm afraid I no longer have the strength to stand.""

He looks at you imploringly. ""You wouldn't happen to have a potion or something you would be willing to give me? I just need a little extra energy to make it back to Gloomhaven."""
event_road_campaign_9_option_a,Help out the guard. 
event_road_campaign_9_option_b,Claim you have no aid to give and move on. 
event_road_campaign_9_result_a,"You happily oblige the request, letting the man partake some of your supplies. He slowly stands up, thanks you, and then heads toward Gloomhaven as you head in the opposite direction. "
event_road_campaign_9_result_b,"You adopt an expression of regret and apologize for a lack of supplies. You then quickly move on your way as he shouts at your back. 

""But... please! You're not just going to leave me here, are you?"""
event_ropebridge,"The path leads you to a ravine, with a rickety old rope bridge as the only way across as far as you can see. The ropes look very worn and the wooden planks rather rotten, but looking for another way across looks like it could take quite some time."
event_ropebridge_a,Cross the rope bridge
event_ropebridge_anotherway,"You're in luck! Not too far along the edge of the ravine you find a large tree has fallen to form a makeshift bridge across thanks to a storm. It appears to be far more sturdy than the rotten rope bridge, so you make your way across without issue."
event_ropebridge_anotherway_gained,"You walk and walk for the rest of the day and still do not find a way across. As dusk falls you finally find the end of the ravine, allowing you to cross over and make the long walk back to the path on the other side, so exhausted by this unexpected detour that you feel a headache coming on."
event_ropebridge_b,Try to find another way across
event_ropebridge_cross,"The rope bridge creaks and sways precariously under your weight with each step, but nonetheless holds and you make it to the other side without issue. You breathe a sigh of relief and continue with your journey."
event_ropebridge_cross_lost,"The rope bridge creaks and sways precariously under your weight with each step. You nearly make it across when it suddenly one of the planks snaps and you fall from the bridge!

You just manage to catch one of the ropes that held the plank before you would fall into the ravine - but a small pouch of gold flies from your belt and disappears into the darkness below.

You pull yourself up and cautiously make it the rest of the way to the other side. You breathe a sigh of relief after such a close call and continue with your journey."
event_shadowsonthewall,"The road you are on leads you to a narrow cliffside path. As the only route in sight to reach the bottom, you begin your descent."
event_shadowsonthewall_a,Descend
event_shadowsonthewall_descent,"You notice the cliff face here is becoming smoother as you descend. Mysterious etchings and carvings start to emerge as you examine the wall. They begin to morph into shadows that swirl and dance about the surface, seemingly leading you along the wall to a spot on the ground.

Tucked into a small alcove at the base of the wall lies an urn, with a small quantity of coins inside."

event_shadowsonthewall_take,"The shadows freeze in place as you take the coins from the urn, before taking the loose form of a menacing face which sends a chill down your spine. In the blink of an eye, the shadows and the smooth wall vanish, leaving behind only the rough cliff face with no sign of the urn you took the gold from.

You continue down the path with a bad feeling niggling away at the back of your mind..."
event_strungup,"Up ahead you see a Quatryl suspended from a tree by his ankles, above a smoldering pile of broken laboratory equipment. As you approach he notices you and cries out:

'Hey, you there, travelers! Help a poor alchemist out, would you?'"
event_strungup_a,Ask him what happened
event_strungup_askhim,"I was brewing up some potions using an untested catalyst...'

He gestures towards the assortment of broken vials and tubes on the floor beneath him.

'Here, a small token of my appreciation!'

You bid each other farewell and continue down the road."

event_the womanofthewoods,"As you continue along your path, an old woman steps out of the trees and blocks your path. She is dressed in ragged clothing, and has a rusty necklace around her neck.

event_thefunguy,"Walking through a wooded glade, you notice something buried in the undergrowth. Upon closer inspection, you see that it is the body of an Inox face down on the ground, clearly long dead. Mushrooms have begun sprouting in clusters all over the decomposing body, and it is giving off a foul stench.

Looking for anything of value on the corpse, you see that the majority of the Inox's gear is far too rotten to be of any use. His boots, however, look potentially salvageable."

With great care, you open the pouch and find a few gold pieces inside! Unable to bear the stench of the corpse any longer, you take the gold and hurriedly leave the area."
event_thefunguy_trytakingboots_poison,"As you remove the boots, they begin to fall apart, and large chunks of putrid flesh from the Inox's feet come off with them. A cloud of spores ejects from the mushrooms disturbed by your removal of the boots and engulfs the party.

You are overwhelmed with a feeling of nausea and jump back from the corpse, but it is too late - you are poisoned. You toss the sodden boots aside and continue through the glade, feeling awful."
event_thelongdead,"The path is getting less and less distinct as you traverse through the a thick forested area. After a while you come to the conclusion that you must have taken a wrong turn, and attempt to find your way back to the path.

You defeat the reanimated remains with several well timed strikes, but not before taking a few hits from their surprise attack.

loading_tip_009,You can adjust the difficulty to your liking if you find yourself struggling or craving a challenge.

message_complete_achievement_1_1_beasttyrantreachlevel2_4,"In response, they will help us against the Rot, it starts near Sweetwater."
message_complete_achievement_1_1_berserkerreachlevel2_1,We’ve received word that the Overseer has returned to Gloomhaven.
message_complete_achievement_1_1_berserkerreachlevel2_2,"He’s dangerous, and he’s got history with the Berserker's clan, so I’m letting her lead the investigation. You need to find him and take him down."

message_complete_achievement_1_1_elementalistreachlevel2_2,I’ve told them to investigate the ruined village of Mudchute near Bloodford. Maybe they can find out how to bolster their own melee abilities!
message_complete_achievement_1_1_mindthiefreachlevel2_1,"The Mindthief has received a hastily-scrawled note from the others in her nest under Demonsgate, warning that humans are threatening her home."
message_complete_achievement_1_1_nightshroudreachlevel2_1,"Now the Nightshroud is firmly part of the team, he has indicated to me that he wants to research some of the rarer enemies found around the land."
message_complete_achievement_1_1_nightshroudreachlevel2_2,How does he want to research them?
message_complete_achievement_1_1_nightshroudreachlevel2_3,By killing them and dissecting their corpses.
message_complete_achievement_1_1_nightshroudreachlevel2_4,"Oh, ‘that’ kind of research?"
message_complete_achievement_1_1_nightshroudreachlevel2_5,Yes. First he’s suggesting heading to The Pyre to collect Spirit ectoplasm.
message_complete_achievement_1_1_quartermasterreachlevel2_1,The Quartermaster has heard from an old colleague in Demonsgate that one of their City Guard equipment stockpiles inside the central vault has been raided.
message_complete_achievement_1_1_quartermasterreachlevel2_2,How much did they take? Some of that equipment is worth a fortune!
message_complete_achievement_1_1_quartermasterreachlevel2_3,"Pretty much everything, enough to outfit a small army… The Quartermaster has been tasked by Demonsgate to investigate."
message_complete_achievement_1_1_quartermasterreachlevel2_4,"We would head straight there, but the vault’s guards were slaughtered - and it appears the thief stole their vault key, too."
message_complete_achievement_1_1_quartermasterreachlevel2_5,I heard Lowtown holds a spare key for the vault. We can head there.
message_complete_achievement_1_1_scoundrelreachlevel2_1,"I woke up this morning and found a letter outside the front door. It's for the Scoundrel, and asks for a rendezvous in the forest. Can I not be the middle man in future please?"
message_complete_achievement_1_1_soothsingerreachlevel2_1,"The Soothsinger asked my advice on places she could go to get inspiration for a few new songs, and I suggested visiting one of the less bloodthirsty Bandit gangs."
message_complete_achievement_1_1_soothsingerreachlevel2_2,There is a group up near Gibbet Hill who might be able to help out.
message_complete_achievement_1_1_spellweaverreachlevel2_1,"We have received a missive for the Spellweaver from the Aesther community, asking for help investigating a disturbance in the magical equilibrium in the Eastern Forest. "

message_complete_achievement_1_1_summonerreachlevel2_4,That sounds bad. We should probably do something about that.
message_complete_achievement_1_1_sunkeeperreachlevel2_1,The Sunkeeper has advised me that she wishes to use her newly found abilities to do good in the land.
message_complete_achievement_1_1_sunkeeperreachlevel2_2,I’ve identified a Vermling Camp near Wayfarer’s Rest that has recently been attacked which may need our help.
message_complete_achievement_1_1_sunkeeperreachlevel2_3,But how will they pay us?.. I don’t understand!
message_complete_achievement_1_1_tinkererreachlevel2_1,The Tinkerer has been studying the origins of Demonology in an effort to try and help defeat them. He's identified somewhere we should investigate.

message_complete_achievement_1_1_unlocklocations_4,"I shall grant you access to my Enhancements. Come visit my tent, and together we shall improve your warriors' prowess. The more towns you unlock, the more powerful you can become."
message_complete_achievement_1_1_unlocklocations_5,"Well, she was straight to the point!"
message_complete_achievement_1_1_unlocklocations_6,"An Enchantress! Be aware, her services don't come cheap. Now we have unlocked more of the world, prepare for the danger to increase. But don't worry, the rewards will follow suit. I've also unlocked some more Achievements to aim for."
message_complete_achievement_1_2_reachdemonspinehollow_1,"After looking in more detail into the area around LowTown, we have found some strange crystals piled up in the forest."
message_complete_achievement_1_2_reachdemonspinehollow_2,"They emit an incredibly strong aura of Earth Magic, and look to have been the cause of the weird behaviour of the Vermlings, as well as the enhanced magical power in the area."
message_complete_achievement_1_2_reachdemonspinehollow_3,We are getting reports of similar magical deviations around the town of Fordingbridge to the South.
message_complete_achievement_1_2_reachfordingbridge_1,"While exploring Fordingbridge a rather unpleasant individual accosted me in the street, he was dripping with what only I can describe as raw sewage."
message_complete_achievement_1_2_reachfordingbridge_2,"I initially waved him away, but he told me he was from the Sweetwater town Council, I laughed, but he was adamant."
message_complete_achievement_1_2_reachfordingbridge_3,"Apparently they have a problem they need looking into. I told him we would investigate it to make him go away, i'll mark Sweetwater on your map."
message_complete_achievement_1_2_reachthesloshedsquirrel_1,I was.. doing some 'important business' in The Sloshed Squirrel and I heard some worrying news from the patrons.
message_complete_achievement_1_2_reachthesloshedsquirrel_2,"It seems travellers to Amberhill have been going missing, and the whole town is in lockdown."
message_complete_achievement_1_2_reachthesloshedsquirrel_3,"Probably worth our while going to check it out and see if we can help or err, make some money?"
message_complete_achievement_1_2_unlocklocations_1,We've reached the coast! That's the first part of the realm reconnected.
message_complete_achievement_1_2_unlocklocations_2,I've also been contacted by some outposts in the Eastern forest. We should start to look there for work too.
message_complete_achievement_1_2_unlocklocations_3,I'll add that to the next set of Achievements to attain!
message_complete_achievement_1_3_unlocklocations_1,"We're a good way through the forest now, and I've had more contacts come in, this time, from the Badlands to the north."
message_complete_achievement_1_3_unlocklocations_2,"Beware though, I've heard rumours of Drakes and Demons. It's not a place for the faint of heart!"
message_complete_achievement_1_4_unlocklocations_1,"The Badlands is well explored now, and we are starting to receive messages from the Great Forest even further north."
message_complete_achievement_1_4_unlocklocations_2,Let's seek out the outposts further North. They are surely to have some impressive equipment to trade!
message_complete_achievement_1_4_unlocklocations_3,Our last Objective now is to reach Wildspire in the depth of the forest.
message_complete_achievement_1_5_unlocklocations_1,"Well done! All the towns to the Barren Coast, the Eastern Forest, The Badlands and up to the Great North Forest have been connected. The first chapter of our Guild's history is complete!"
message_complete_achievement_1_5_unlocklocations_2,It seems the villages of the realm have banded together to reward us with a nice pile of gold coins!
message_end_quest_story_2d_1,Great work getting through the basic training missions. Allow me to introduce you to the third member of the Guild; he ain't much of a fighter though...
message_end_quest_story_2d_2,"Hey, not all of us particularly care to be experts at stabbing people!

Oh, err... please excuse me. *Ahem*"
message_end_quest_story_2d_3,"Greetings, guildmaster. I'm the humble <b>Merchant</b> of your fledgling Guild. I deal with the important aspects of running a Guild... in other words, <i>money</i>. Which, might I add, is sorely lacking at the moment..."
message_end_quest_story_2d_4,"What you can see right now is the <b>World Map</b>. You've probably noticed it looks a bit barren at the moment, and, well... I've got some good news and some bad news for you.

The bad news is that the realm has been overrun with all manner of unpleasant monsters - rogue bandits, wandering undead, dark cultists, you name it. The good news is that you're going to help us restore the routes back to the other settlements out there, hidden in the fog."
message_end_quest_story_2d_5,"Before we can do anything about that however, we'll need to get some mercenaries on the Guild roster. Let's start with actually recruiting the poor old <b>Brute</b>, who's got himself into a spot of bother... again."
message_end_quest_story_3a_1,"The <b>Brute</b> sure can soak up damage well, but he’s not the most mobile."
message_end_quest_story_3a_2,"Having ample funds is going to be of utmost importance in getting this Guild off the ground. Do you know anyone good at... erm, gold acquisition?"
message_end_quest_story_3a_3,"I know just the woman - she’s also a dab hand at poking holes in those who get in her way. She's in the process of liberating some gold right now, shall we lend her a hand?"
message_end_quest_story_3b_1,"The first thing we should do as a Guild is re-establish the trade route with Gibbet Hill to the West. We’ve been having a small problem with bandits in the woodland en route, but with the Brute and Scoundrel to assist, that's nothing that should cause you any trouble."
message_end_quest_story_3b_2,"It’ll give you some much needed experience on the job, and allow me to get some new <b>item</b>s in stock once the way is cleared. Go knock some bandit heads together!"
message_end_quest_story_4a_1,"It's about time you learned about the fundamentals of magic. I know a <b>Spellweaver </b>who should be able to show you a thing or two, and last I heard from her, she was researching a stone circle in a forest nearby Gibbet Hill. With all these monsters about, we ought to check she's OK."
message_end_quest_story_5a_1,That's the elemental schools of magic covered. Perhaps we could do with recruiting someone who understands hi-tech contraptions and such? I swear there was a Quatryl <b>Tinkerer</b> messing about with a power core or some other artifact in the tavern not too long ago...
message_end_quest_story_5a_2,"Good call. I heard he was looking for fellow explorers to investigate a tomb nearby, barkeep said he set off yesterday. Sounds to me like the sort who might be interested in joining a Guild such as our own - let's see if we can find him!"
message_end_quest_story_5b_1,"We're getting a proper mercenary guild together now! Speaking of paid jobs, I've met someone who has requested our help."
message_end_quest_story_5b_2,"Peace be with you. I am the <b>Priestess</b> here, sworn to the Sanctuary of the Great Oak. I thank you for meeting with me, as we at the Sanctuary are in dire need of assistance.

You see, the holy crypt in the catacombs beneath the Sanctuary has been broken into and defiled by deranged cultists, raising hordes of undead to do their nefarious bidding... I beg of thee, please help us be rid of this menace!"
message_end_quest_story_5b_3,"All too common an occurrence these days... Anyhow, sounds like an opportunity to try out our two latest recruits together - get to it."
message_end_quest_story_5c_1,"I cannot express just how grateful I am... Truly, thank you. With the threat to the Sanctuary gone, we can finally resume the restoration of the Temple here. It will be some time before we are ready to resume our normal services, but I hope we can be of help in the future. I bid you farewell."
message_end_quest_story_5c_2,"Hang on a second, we did that for <i>free</i>?! I thought we were supposed to be looking for paid jo- Oh, never mind...

<size=90%>Join a guild, they said... <size=80%>It'll be fun, they said... <size=70%>""You'll make heaps of gold""... Pfft! <size=60%>*Grumble grumble*"
message_end_quest_story_5c_3,"Don't mind him. Thanks to you, the Temple will reopen in due time, and you will be glad to receive their blessings.

Now, the next village we've lost contact with is The Marches. The route is under lockdown after a number of raids from small bands of Vermlings camping nearby."
message_end_quest_story_5c_4,"I want you to head up North and see if you can drive them out.

Oh, and watch out for their hounds. Let these scars across my face be a warning to you - you get up close to those dogs and they'll bite back!"
message_end_quest_story_6a_1,"Just one more route to clear, and I should have re-established contact with enough suppliers to reopen my shop for business! I'm sure you can't wait to get your hands on some decent gear."
message_end_quest_story_6a_2,"There's some incentive for you! As your core training nears its end, I hope you are getting used to how the various abilities and effects interact with each other. You'll certainly be needing some advanced techniques on the quests to come!"
message_end_quest_story_6a_3,"Anyhow, I’ve tracked down a potential fifth mercenary for our crew, if you can get him on board. This guy has fists of stone, and I mean literally! "
message_end_quest_story_7a_1,<b>Cragheart</b>'s on board - that’s five mercenaries recruited! I reckon just one more and we should have a large enough crew to take on some quests further out from Demonsgate.
message_end_quest_story_7a_2,"Y'know, if we can find someone capable of summoning allies to the battlefield, it'll feel like we have even more mercs still! I know some Vermlings are quite proficient at handling beastly brethren of theirs."
message_end_quest_story_7a_3,Vermlings? We're going to recruit a Vermling?
message_end_quest_story_7a_4,"Don't let the rodent exterior fool you, they aren't all feral scavengers. Some Vermlings develop strong psychic abilities - and rumour has it one such Vermling <b>Mindthief</b> is hunting down demons nearby. Would you say no to a demon hunter joining the Guild just because she looks a bit rattish?

I vote we find this <b>Mindthief</b> and see if she fancies joining us for a chance at greater glory... than hunting demons. Okay, perhaps not <i>greater</i> glory just yet, but glory all the same."
message_end_quest_story_7b_1,"Now we’ve got the Guild going, we're starting to get job requests coming in from far and wide. I'm also hearing rumours regarding the locations of powerful artifacts that could be worth investigating."
message_end_quest_story_7b_2,"In fact, you should check this one out first: A few nights ago a falling star was said to have been seen landing in a forest clearing near Gibbet Hill, but when villagers went to investigate, there was no trace of anything having landed there."
message_end_quest_story_7b_3,"A day or so later, they started experiencing minor earthquakes emanating just north of the village, not far from the clearing. Nothing up there except an old, decrepit crypt - and the villagers, being villagers, are too scared to investigate. "
message_end_quest_story_7b_4,"Sounds like a magical artifact of some kind to me, you should go check it out!"
message_end_quest_story_7b_5,"I recommend you bring along the <b>Cragheart</b> and <b>Mindthief</b>, they should easily be up to the task."
message_end_quest_story_7c_1,"And so, that concludes your training. The world is your oyster - a bandit-ridden, undead-roaming, demon-infested oyster.

We've put together a set of starting equipment with the money you've earned thus far, but any other gear you fancy you'll need to buy."
message_end_quest_story_7c_10,"Choose your team, gear 'em up and you're ready to go. Good luck, guildmaster!"
message_end_quest_story_7c_11,Multiplayer is now enabled.
message_end_quest_story_7c_2,"The panel on the left is used to choose your party's line-up, and to customise their ability cards and items as you unlock more. You now also have free rein over which mercenaries to bring along on each mission, up to a maximum of four.

Be aware though, scenario difficulty scales with the number of player characters. Unless you are a <b>Gloomhaven</b> veteran, I would recommend you stick with two characters for the time being to keep the decision making manageable!"
message_end_quest_story_7c_3,"When equipping items, note that whoever equips an item first has it bound to them. You can unbind an item for a cost, but try to make sure you give it to the right mercenary the first time if you can."
message_end_quest_story_7c_4,"To aid you in progressing your skills post-training, I have come up with a set of achievements for you to work towards. These can be accessed by the <b>Trainer</b> icon at the bottom of the screen. "
message_end_quest_story_7c_5,"Completing these will reward the Guild with more gold, quests, and locations to discover. Sometimes even missions to recover powerful relics!"
message_end_quest_story_7c_6,"You can pop by my shop by clicking the Merchant icon at the bottom of the screen. I've got mostly basic items in stock right now, but as you keep exploring and restore the routes to more villages, more and more items will be added to my stock!"
message_end_quest_story_7c_7,"Speaking of which, could you journey down to the southwestern coast and open up the old spice routes?"
message_end_quest_story_7c_8,I've had links with two towns there in the past: Bloodford to the West...
message_end_quest_story_7c_9,...and Wanderer's Rest to the South West.
message_end_quest_story_banditcommander_1,"With the Bandit Commander dead, the temples and the Demonsgate nest are now safe."
message_end_quest_story_banditcommander_2,"Well, it’s good to see the back of him, and that ring you got looks pretty useful."
message_end_quest_story_beasttyrant_1_1,"This Rot is worse than we first thought, it is spreading over the whole land."
message_end_quest_story_beasttyrant_1_2,The Beast Tyrant now wants us to investigate another outbreak in the Eastern forest near The Hermitage.
message_end_quest_story_beasttyrant_2_1,I’ve talked in depth with the Beast Tyrant and triangulated the spread of the Rot.
message_end_quest_story_beasttyrant_2_2,"As we had originally surmised, it seems to spread via freshwater that originates from the mountains to the south, near Obsidian Bluff."
message_end_quest_story_beasttyrant_2_3,But there is also a second tributary in the area of Rockfall further to the East.
message_end_quest_story_beasttyrant_2_4,We believe that is where the Deep Terrors are primarily breeding and is where we must head next.
message_end_quest_story_beasttyrant_3_1,"I’ve investigated further into the cave, and found an immature specimen which I believe is what ultimately becomes a Deep Terror."
message_end_quest_story_beasttyrant_3_2,"I’ll research further, but I believe I may be able to develop a potion to allow us to confuse the Rot into thinking we are an ally."
message_end_quest_story_berserker_1_1,"I looked for something to sell after you left, but only found one of the bandits’ journals. Apparently the Overseer is heading to Ironwood Camp to start an army. I say we head there next - they might have something I can stock. "
message_end_quest_story_berserker_2_1,"Can you believe a place called Ironwood has no Iron or wood to take and sell? I did poke around in the ledgers though, it looks like these wagons were heading to a cave outside Drake Fire Farm. Sounds like we will be heading there too, then."
message_end_quest_story_berserker_3_1,"So, I took a look at what you grabbed. Don’t worry, not even I would try to sell it back to you after what you went through to get it."
message_end_quest_story_berserker_3_2,"Anyway, it turns out you stole the map for the entire cave system… and we’ve found a way to sneak you in through a side entrance..."
message_end_quest_story_berserker_3_3,...But it’s got a pretty hefty lock on it. We’re stuck until we find a way to open it.
message_end_quest_story_brute_1_1,"I’ll return to my trade camp near the Copper Oasis and see if any others of my clan have heard any rumours. Come visit me when you are ready, and I’ll tell you what I have found out."
message_end_quest_story_brute_2_1,"The traitor didn’t even lead his troops into battle, no wonder their morale broke. He isn’t much of a commander!"
message_end_quest_story_brute_2_2,"We’ve located both his main mustering ground, but also some ruins nearby where he has troops performing strange rites. It's probably worth raiding the ruins first and seeing what he is up to."
message_end_quest_story_cragheart_1_1,"The Shrine of the Roots is found in the forest near Lowtown. If they are being systematically looted, I worry that would be a prime target."
message_end_quest_story_cragheart_2_1,These are some highly organised Looters.... there must be someone in charge of all this planning. We need to find out who and make an example of them.
message_end_quest_story_cragheart_2_2,"For now, however, we should check out the last of the three temples: the Shrine of Verglas, near River’s Rise"
message_end_quest_story_cragheart_3_1,"The three core shrines are now safe. Only the mythical Shrine of the Ashes remains, but no one knows of its location."
message_end_quest_story_cragheart_3_2,"Well, if we don’t know of it, nor will the looters!"
message_end_quest_story_elementalist_1_1,"The Elementalist searches the ruined structures and finds some old scrolls from the mayor’s office. It seems after Swagger’s defence of the village, the settlement ended up in huge debt."
message_end_quest_story_elementalist_1_2,"The payments are addressed to a tower located near to modern-day Silverwick, in the mountains to the East. It looks like we should head there next."
message_end_quest_story_elementalist_2_1,"The library contains many musty tomes on all forms of magic, although almost all have since been disproved as poorly-researched, and are now only useful as kindling."
message_end_quest_story_elementalist_2_2,"There is one book of Swagger’s handwritten notes. It both details the payments from Mudchute, and talks of the ‘power of the gods’ given at an ancient temple, accompanied by a crude map."
message_end_quest_story_elementalist_2_3,"Looking at this paperwork, it looks as if the Bandits were in Swagger’s pay all along, and that he bankrupted Mudchute to get enough gold to donate at this temple."
message_end_quest_story_elementalist_2_4,The map looks like the edge of the forest up near the School of the Great Oak. Can’t have changed much in a hundred years.
message_end_quest_story_elementalist_2_5,"Right, we know where to head next then!"
message_end_quest_story_elementalist_3_1,"This temple held a portal to the demonic realm. Swagger must have passed through to gain his powers, and returned to our realm through a different portal."
message_end_quest_story_elementalist_3_2,But he never came back did he? Otherwise he’d have laid waste to the land?
message_end_quest_story_elementalist_3_3,"It seems not. Also, we found some strange symbols etched onto the wall next to the portal. They almost look like musical notes?"
message_end_quest_story_highcultist_1,"We did a sweep of the area after you left, and mopped up a few more Cultists. We found this incense burner too, which I reckon will come in pretty useful!"
message_end_quest_story_highcultist_2,"Also, it feels as though the elements are in balance again, now that the High Cultist is dead. Good work."
message_end_quest_story_inoxbodyguard_1,"I doubt that’ll be the last Inox Leader we’ll ever see, but the Brute is finally avenged."
message_end_quest_story_inoxbodyguard_2,I hope any other ones carry more of these awesome axes!
message_end_quest_story_jekserah_1,"The Summoner tells me that according to Jekserah’s notes, the book we recovered contains a powerful spell written just for the sanctuary we cleared."
message_end_quest_story_jekserah_2,Jekserah knew the Summoner would be interested in it. It seems she had us do her dirty work for her...
message_end_quest_story_jekserah_3,"When cast in the sanctuary, the spell would be amplified until it could raise and control all of Gloomhaven’s dead. It’s fascinating magic - which I will guard."
message_end_quest_story_jekserah_4,"Jekserah’s ring, however, isn’t guarded by the Enchantress - and seems to harbour potent magic. I would keep it... but it stinks of Undead. Think of it as a reward?"
message_end_quest_story_mercilessoverseer_1,"So, I spoke to Vermlings after you left. They owe us for what we did, after all."
message_end_quest_story_mercilessoverseer_2,"They don’t have much to give, being slaves, but one gave me an Ancient Drill as an attempt at thanks... well, they didn’t kill us for our flesh either, I suppose."
message_end_quest_story_mercilessoverseer_3,"Anyway, the drill will do. It’s too old to have any value though, so I can guess you can just have it. A freebie."
message_end_quest_story_mindthief_1_1,"With your family scattered into the sewers around Demonsgate, you tell them to head to Lowtown, where you will catch up with them later."
message_end_quest_story_mindthief_2_1,You return the supplies to your makeshift nest. The young are especially pleased to have something substantial to eat.
message_end_quest_story_mindthief_2_2,"You realise however, that this location is temporary. You must plan to return to your own nest, and drive those who took it away."
message_end_quest_story_nightshroud_1_1,The Nightshroud has taken away the ectoplasm and has started doing some research in the basement of the Guild.
message_end_quest_story_nightshroud_1_2,I wondered what that smell was.
message_end_quest_story_nightshroud_1_3,"He’s now come to me with a mission to recover some Harrower Essence from Hound Hill, I’ll put it on the map."
message_end_quest_story_nightshroud_2_1,"Most of the Harrowers dissipated after death, but the Nightshroud managed to bottle some insectile remnants."
message_end_quest_story_nightshroud_2_2, Do we know ‘why’ he is doing this?
message_end_quest_story_nightshroud_2_3,"It’s something to do with a Rot affecting the land, next he wants to take down some Lurkers in Crystal Hollow."
message_end_quest_story_nightshroud_3_1,"The Nightshroud has started his experiment with the creature’s remains, he hopes it will give us an insight into the origin of the Rot."
message_end_quest_story_nightshroud_3_2," I hope so too, as then I can move back into the Guild when the terrible smells have gone."
message_end_quest_story_nightshroud_3_3,"Staying above the tavern is costing me a fortune, and I seem to be spending more time drinking!"
message_end_quest_story_quartermaster_1_1,"I’m not sure how Living Corpses got into a Vermling nest, but at least we can investigate the Demonsgate Vault now."
message_end_quest_story_quartermaster_1_2,Why can’t you ever take me anywhere nice?
message_end_quest_story_quartermaster_1_3,I’ve also informed Demonsgate of the custodian’s death. I suspect they’ll have words with the Lowtown garrison.
message_end_quest_story_quartermaster_2_1,"I’ve studied the green substance you retrieved from the Vault. It’s only found at Kailej, inside a cave the locals believe to be hexed."
message_end_quest_story_quartermaster_2_2,"First an empty ancient vault, now a cursed cave…"
message_end_quest_story_quartermaster_2_3,"You know these are the places we are paid to enter, right?"
message_end_quest_story_quartermaster_2_4,Doesn’t mean I have to like it.
message_end_quest_story_quartermaster_3_1,The forest you discovered fits an old Inox myth of a hidden sanctuary which strengthens all those inside it. It’s a groundbreaking academic discovery.
message_end_quest_story_quartermaster_3_2,"The artifact is similarly intriguing. It’s a hemisphere, with a strange design engraved on it, alongside a sentence in an old Valrath dialect."
message_end_quest_story_quartermaster_3_3,"It reads: ‘Your demise opens like necks, but with the start of joy. Come forth, have your body join my employ.’"
message_end_quest_story_quartermaster_3_4,"Neither me or the Quartermaster know a thing about it. We’ll need to solve this before we get pa- er, before we find the stockpile. It likely leads to our thief."
message_end_quest_story_scoundrel_1_1,I’ve heard that South Shield has put a bounty on the head of a big ol’ Inox who’s been leading attacks on the village. He might be your guy. I’ll mark it on your map.
message_end_quest_story_scoundrel_2_1,"You know what, that looks like the forest up near Eaglecrest. I’d bet my favourite hat on it. Probably best to get up there and ask around: they’ll know if any Inox are in the area."
message_end_quest_story_sightlesseye_1,"With the Eye dead, we have reports that most areas of Rot are receding, but there could still be pockets of it around the land."
message_end_quest_story_sightlesseye_2,"...What happened, what was that smell?"
message_end_quest_story_sightlesseye_3,You passed out.
message_end_quest_story_sightlesseye_4,Probably the smartest thing I’ve ever done...
message_end_quest_story_soothsinger_1_1,"You talk to the remaining Bandits, but none of them have any explanation as to why the camp was attacked by Undead."
message_end_quest_story_soothsinger_1_2,Perhaps it was on an old Inox Burial Ground?
message_end_quest_story_soothsinger_1_3,"The good news is that the Soothsinger got some new bawdy tunes. I suggest we visit some Vermlings to learn some insults next, I know just the place!"
message_end_quest_story_soothsinger_2_1,What is going on? It seems someone doesn’t want us to learn new songs?
message_end_quest_story_soothsinger_2_2,"I think it is more serious than that, but it does seem related to the Soothsinger in some way."
message_end_quest_story_soothsinger_2_3,"In that case, we need to pre-empt the next attack, I’ll talk to some of my Inox friends and prepare a welcome party."
message_end_quest_story_soothsinger_3_1,"It took me a little while, but we got him to talk, you aren’t going to believe this…"
message_end_quest_story_soothsinger_3_2,Apparently he is working for some kind of skeletal champion who has a grudge against our Soothsinger.
message_end_quest_story_soothsinger_3_3,She is the descendant of a bard who sealed him in a tower to the north of Summerwell
message_end_quest_story_soothsinger_3_4,"But there is no way into the tower, it has a magical lock on it"
message_end_quest_story_spellweaver_1_1,"That Bandit’s dressed in the gear of the Emerald Knaves, from up near Eastgrove. I’d check out their base of operations next."
message_end_quest_story_spellweaver_2_1,"After hearing of your predicament, the Keeper of the Oak offers some words of advice."
message_end_quest_story_spellweaver_2_2,"In our Library at the Temple, there are writings of a shrine where you may ask for a boon in times of crisis. I feel this is one of those times."
message_end_quest_story_spellweaver_2_3,"I’ll mark the known location on the map, but usually you must prove your worth before it is granted."
message_end_quest_story_spellweaver_2_4,Simply say ‘I Require A Boon’ and all will be revealed.
message_end_quest_story_spellweaver_3_1,What did she get then?
message_end_quest_story_spellweaver_3_2,"We do not know, but it will reveal itself when needed."
message_end_quest_story_spellweaver_3_3,"Well, that's not vague at all is it? Couldn’t it just have given us a big flaming sword or something?"
message_end_quest_story_summoner_1_1,"The Summoner wanted more time in there, but she reckons she saw enough to know how to disconnect the realms now."
message_end_quest_story_summoner_1_2,She used my personal spellbooks to work it out. The Summoner says it cites another spellbook we’ll need - a tome lost to an abandoned library outside Mudview.
message_end_quest_story_summoner_1_3,Sounds like the perfect business opportunity! I might even tag along.
message_end_quest_story_summoner_2_1,"I’ve just had quite the talk with the Summoner. The book you reclaimed isn’t needed to close the rift. It just ‘sounded interesting’, and she fancied a read."
message_end_quest_story_summoner_2_2,"She almost killed us for a lost spellbook she doesn’t even need? ...We can sell it, right?"
message_end_quest_story_summoner_2_3,"On the contrary. She still needs the book, just not for the rift. The Summoner now has a safer way for you all to travel back into that dungeon..."
message_end_quest_story_summoner_3_1,"This hemisphere you’ve brought me, neither I nor the Summoner can find how it relates to the interplanar rift."
message_end_quest_story_summoner_3_2,"It has some kind of drawing carved in on the side, alongside an inscription written in a rare, old Valrath tongue."
message_end_quest_story_summoner_3_3,"The inscription roughly reads: ‘It ends a Seraph, without the beginning of pride. And see all who oppose the new queen subside.’ Curious."
message_end_quest_story_sunkeeper_1_1,"Now the Sunkeeper has earned their trust, they say that City Guards came to their camp and wanted to take some of them away."
message_end_quest_story_sunkeeper_1_2,They resisted and the Guards attacked!
message_end_quest_story_sunkeeper_1_3,"Although they were unable to stop the Guards from kidnapping some of their tribe, they have tracked them to this location near Mudview."
message_end_quest_story_sunkeeper_2_1,"Well, that map points clearly to Mistfell copse."
message_end_quest_story_sunkeeper_2_2,We should have these slavers taken down by tea-time.
message_end_quest_story_sunkeeper_3_1,It seems the Sunkeeper grabbed a key from around the neck of a Harrower Corpse.
message_end_quest_story_sunkeeper_3_2,"If we can find the actual base of operations, we’ll have a way in!"
message_end_quest_story_tinkerer_1_1,"These scrolls refer to a temple in the forest far to the north west, past even the School of the Great Oak. It looks as if that is the next area to investigate."
message_end_quest_story_tinkerer_2_1,"The documentation you have discovered will allow you to perform some rituals of your own. You decide to do this under the Guild itself, in case anything goes wrong!"
message_end_quest_story_tinkerer_3_1,"When your sight returns, the Demon has gone, returned to its own realm. You think this whole experiment was a mistake, when you smell burning…"
message_end_quest_story_tinkerer_3_2,"A map on the wall has a small hole burned through it, a spot just outside the location of ‘The Dome’. You wonder if the Sun Demon was trying to tell you something..."
message_end_quest_story_undeadcommander_1,It seems that Melody has tracked Swagger to the same temple we did and then employed a number of priests to create a spell of binding that only a bard could unlock.
message_end_quest_story_undeadcommander_2,"We may not have got much else from this quest, but I did find this er… Skull on the floor."
message_end_quest_story_undeadcommander_3,"Not even I can sell this, so here you go, it gives me the creeps."
message_end_quest_travel_amberhill_1,"So the City Guard are killing people now? That’s definitely not the kind of protection I pay my taxes for - though I do, er, definitely pay my taxes."
message_end_quest_travel_amberhill_2,"Luckily, Amberhill is known for their enchanted wearables, made with a local magical Amber tree. "
message_end_quest_travel_amberhill_3,They’ve given me a lovely pair of Boots of Speed to help us on our way. Visit my store when you can!
message_end_quest_travel_bloodford_1,"Glad you made it through okay. The trade route is already back in action, and I should have some Stun Powder in stock when you return."
message_end_quest_travel_bloodford_2,"We should get other trade route requests in now, so let’s keep expanding the network. Before you start... go have a bath, for everyone’s sake..."
message_end_quest_travel_crystalhollow_1,I’ve always imagined the riches I would find inside the Crystal Hollow.. the cave of legends!
message_end_quest_travel_crystalhollow_2,"It wasn’t great. Most of it was just mushrooms, and not even the magic kind."
message_end_quest_travel_crystalhollow_3,"But, a fight with a spider led me to fall o- er, discover a half-buried halberd. It seems pretty hefty, and it’s in my store."
message_end_quest_travel_demonspinehollow_1,"I always thought tales of Imps were a load of cobblers, but apparently that’s what Demonspine Hollow is known for. Cobblers that is, not Imps, Come have a look at the new Boots in stock."
message_end_quest_travel_drakefirefarm_1,The farmers of Drake Fire Farm have taken the spores of some of the strange plants nearby and made some powder bombs.
message_end_quest_travel_drakefirefarm_2,"I’ve not tried them myself, but they seem… unpleasant. I’m sure you’ll love them."
message_end_quest_travel_eaglecrest_1,"I received a parcel from Eaglecrest today, from one of the Tinkerer shops there. Apparently a group of Inox paid to ship us a Telescopic Sight."
message_end_quest_travel_eaglecrest_2,"I don’t know if that is a thank you gift, or a withering statement on your martial prowess?"
message_end_quest_travel_eastgrove_1,"Did you know that Eastgrove used to have a detachment of ancient Royal Guard? I didn’t either, but I now have a set of Platemail in the store for you!"
message_end_quest_travel_fordingbridge_1,"Boneshatter Pass to the South East used to be the home to the greatest shoemakers in the area, but it seems Fordingbridge learned some of their craft as a stopping point on the way."
message_end_quest_travel_fordingbridge_2,I’ve got an interesting pair of shoes in stock now.
message_end_quest_travel_hammerholm_1,The blacksmiths of Hammerholm were overjoyed with your work. I have some new armour in stock!
message_end_quest_travel_houndhill_1,"The townspeople are just overjoyed that you drove those disgusting Harrowers out, and gave me a Falcon Figurine."
message_end_quest_travel_houndhill_2,"You’d expect a Hound Figurine, right? Well, apparently falcons are spiritual or something. Anyway, It’s in the store."
message_end_quest_travel_ironbell_1,"I popped into Ironbell after you left to find a weapon of my own. I’m not going to join you on the front line, but I, er, wanted to feel part of the action."
message_end_quest_travel_ironbell_2,"When I told one of the blacksmiths this, she looked at me... and then gave me these Steel Sabatons."
message_end_quest_travel_ironbell_3,"I’ll take the hint. If you could use them, they’re in my store."
message_end_quest_travel_ironwoodcamp_1,"The Ironwood Company are overjoyed with your work, and have sent me through the design for a new shield. Come check it out when you get a chance!"
message_end_quest_travel_kailej_1,I took a trip to Kailej after you left. I figured a warrior tribe must have some pretty valuable weapons. 
message_end_quest_travel_kailej_2,"When I asked the blacksmith for the kind of weapon she thought I’d use, she handed me a pretty ring. That hurt, I’ll admit"
message_end_quest_travel_kailej_3,"I didn’t think it did anything until someone tried to accost me later that night, and I ran away faster than usual… so if you don’t want it, I’ll probably wear it myself."
message_end_quest_travel_keyport_1,"So, it seems like the city of Keyport is very much in our debt."
message_end_quest_travel_keyport_2,I visited the town hall after you left to see how they plan to compensate us… and could you believe they weren’t going to pay us? They just muttered something about ‘eternal gratitude’
message_end_quest_travel_keyport_3,"Well, I pointed out a rather nice axe on their wall. Apparently it's important to the city’s history, but seeing as we saved the city, it’s now in my store. Take a look when you can."
message_end_quest_travel_lowtown_1,"Lowtown isn’t exactly the height of sophistication, I’m afraid. I couldn’t find anything to add to the shop’s inventory."
message_end_quest_travel_lowtown_2,"I don’t know what you mean, these Hooked Chains would be great in a fight. Use them to drag your enemies within melee range, then Thwack!"
message_end_quest_travel_lowtown_3,They were just holding some crates of potatoes together..
message_end_quest_travel_millpond_1,"An old man who used to live in Millpond heard about us trying to save his hometown, and gifted us his traditional Millpondian Reaping Scythe which he used to harvest crops with."
message_end_quest_travel_millpond_2,"Who knows, maybe you’ll find a use for it? It’s in my store."
message_end_quest_travel_mudview_1,"Boy, am I glad I stayed inside the walls of Amberhill."
message_end_quest_travel_mudview_2,"Anyway, I managed to barter for the Harrower’s cloak after you left."
message_end_quest_travel_mudview_3,"It smells weird and there might be an insect or two left, but it seems to have a lot of storage space."
message_end_quest_travel_nasitra_1,"Nasitra is known for it’s beautiful jewellery, so I’ve sourced some magical Moon Earrings you might find helpful."
message_end_quest_travel_nomadcamp_1,"I had a walk about the camp after you left - thankful people are often the most generous, after all."
message_end_quest_travel_nomadcamp_2,"One of the survivors offered me a ring as a way of thanks, which I gladly put on..."
message_end_quest_travel_nomadcamp_3,"I tried to punch them in response, without even realising! I’m fairly sure the ring made me do it."
message_end_quest_travel_nomadcamp_4,"Needless to say, I won’t be seeking out those nomads again. I’d appreciate it if you’d buy the ring before something worse happens."
message_end_quest_travel_obsidianbluff_1,You should thank me. I travelled all the way to that dungeon and braved its corridors to find something to se- to help you in our quest.
message_end_quest_travel_obsidianbluff_2,"There wasn’t much beside blood and eldritch squiggles, but I did find another ring. I was happy to leave with just that."
message_end_quest_travel_obsidianbluff_3,"But, of course, I walked straight into a room with a stray Black Imp. I wished I hadn’t, and suddenly I was back in the corridor again."
message_end_quest_travel_obsidianbluff_4,"I have a mind to keep the ring, but it’s in my store as a token of my generosity… buy it before I change my mind!"
message_end_quest_travel_riversrise_1,"Some villagers scouted out the deeper rooms of the temple after you left, and have got me a few powerful healing potions. They should certainly help."
message_end_quest_travel_rockfall_1,The Demons attacked from the South. The only destination in that direction is the old tower called Spitepeak.
message_end_quest_travel_rockfall_2,It seems that is where the Savvas’ base will be found.
message_end_quest_travel_rockfall_3,"The Savvas have given me a charm, which they say may help you in the fight against their brethren."
message_end_quest_travel_sahmyrt_1,"Ah thank goodness, with the spice route back open, my food can actually start to have some flavour again!"
message_end_quest_travel_sahmyrt_2,I’ve also been able to get some important ingredients to start supplying Major Stamina Potions. Many warriors value these really highly!
message_end_quest_travel_saltmarshflats_1,"I couldn’t wait to get into Saltmarsh Flats. I mean, a city of magicians? There was bound to be some amazing things in there!"
message_end_quest_travel_saltmarshflats_2,Their shop was full of ancient relics and powerful items… I was just about to take a flaming sword when the owner saw me trying to blow it out so I could hide it.
message_end_quest_travel_saltmarshflats_3,"I grabbed some boots with ‘quick’ on their label instead, put them on, and used them to escape fast."
message_end_quest_travel_saltmarshflats_4,"They’re now in the store, and I suggest you buy them. I’m not going back for anything else."
message_end_quest_travel_schoolofthegreatoak_1,Advocates from the temple have supplied me with an old helmet that guards from a previous order used to wear.
message_end_quest_travel_schoolofthegreatoak_2,"I’m not sure why a group of healers would need to instill fear in their subjects, then again, I’ve never really understood religion as a rule."
message_end_quest_travel_scurvybay_1,"Normally I try to steer clear of criminals, but I decided to see what these bandits had on offer - for you, of course."
message_end_quest_travel_scurvybay_2,They just threw this Volatile Bomb at me. I’m still not quite sure whether it was a gift or a threat.
message_end_quest_travel_scurvybay_3,"Either way, it hasn’t exploded… yet. It’s in my store, but I suggest you hurry up."
message_end_quest_travel_shaderest_1,"I’ve done a deal with a local trinket maker to make some interesting Talismans. Come and have a look, you might find them useful?"
message_end_quest_travel_shadowfieldmanor_1,"I received a package by courier this morning and it had a pretty piece of jewellery in it. However, every time I look at it it turns my stomach. Probably means you’ll find a use for it!"
message_end_quest_travel_shimmeringshallows_1,I popped into town and met a friendly old fisherwife after you left.
message_end_quest_travel_shimmeringshallows_2,"Turns out, the town is in love with fishing, and she is in love with, er, me. I just about escaped with my clothes on... and a Long Spear."
message_end_quest_travel_shimmeringshallows_3,Come have a look at my store if you think you could use it.
message_end_quest_travel_silverwick_1,"You head away from the burned copse, and the journey to Silverwick passes without any more trouble."
message_end_quest_travel_silverwick_2,"Silverwick’s trade route is open once again, and the thankful villagers have given me a smart-looking helmet for you to try out."
message_end_quest_travel_silverwick_3,"I’ve been contacted by a considerable amount of villagers from Rockfall, a Savvas community to the East."
message_end_quest_travel_silverwick_4,"They are concerned that the recent occurrences are due to a group of rogue magic users who left their community for Wayward, and think that we should head there next."
message_end_quest_travel_southshield_1,"This is it! We’ve got to the southwestern tip of the realm, and I now have access to the armourers that give South Shield its name."
message_end_quest_travel_spitepeak_1,This should ensure peace returns to the land.
message_end_quest_travel_spitepeak_2,Maybe for a whole day if we are lucky!
message_end_quest_travel_spitepeak_3,I popped into the tower after you left and picked up an interesting staff that someone left behind. Perhaps you can find a use for it?
message_end_quest_travel_staybrightfort_1,"Staybright Fort is very big and old, so I thought I’d nip in to see what treasures its basement hides."
message_end_quest_travel_staybrightfort_2,"Turns out, the damn thing is full of unstable explosives. Just… why?!"
message_end_quest_travel_staybrightfort_3,"I managed to get some out safely. I don’t know what you’ll do with it, but I’d encourage you to buy it before it explodes."
message_end_quest_travel_summerwell_1,"After resting in the cave and continuing to Summerwell, the weather was a lot milder."
message_end_quest_travel_summerwell_2,"The villagers are overjoyed that the cold snap they had experienced is over. Although, their vineyards are ruined..."
message_end_quest_travel_summerwell_3,One of the villagers sent me an ornate dagger as a thank you. You might find it useful?
message_end_quest_travel_summerwell_4,"Apparently, the Savvas have left for an ancient Savvas Temple in an extinct volcano in the mountains. We should head there next."
message_end_quest_travel_sweetwater_1,"Fortunately Sweetwater isn’t all sewer, so I had a poke around once the villagers had scrubbed the town down."
message_end_quest_travel_sweetwater_2,"I managed to find a solid helmet in a bush. It stunk worse than a Cultist’s table, but I couldn’t pass it up."
message_end_quest_travel_sweetwater_3,"Apparently it had an owner, but she slipped on some stray sewage chasing me, so I guess it's a lucky helmet. It’s in my store when you get a chance."
message_end_quest_travel_templeoftheacorn_1,Thank you for cleansing the temple of those vile Hounds! Our followers will soon return and get the site functional again.
message_end_quest_travel_templeoftheacorn_2,"As a token of our thanks, we will supply your merchant with our powerful healing potions."
message_end_quest_travel_thebarrencoast_1,"We are now linked with the coastal traders, which means I have some access to items from across the sea. Something you might be interested in is a cool winged Helm, come have a look!"
message_end_quest_travel_theburiedtrenches_1,"Ruins from an ancient civilisation, just freed of monsters? Of course I went back after you left, and you better be glad I did."
message_end_quest_travel_theburiedtrenches_2,"I spotted a pair of greaves near the reservoir, and pulled them out of some questionable goo."
message_end_quest_travel_theburiedtrenches_3,"They are MUCH heavier than they look, but are still in decent condition. Heavy means useful… right? Take a look when you can."
message_end_quest_travel_thecityofslate_1,"The first item dug up from the city was an amulet with healing properties, it’s now in stock. Have you ever wondered why so many corpses have a healing potion in their pockets...?"
message_end_quest_travel_thecopperoasis_1,"Some local Inox tribesman are supplying me with some of their weighted nets, perhaps you might find a use for them in combat… The nets that is, not the tribesmen."
message_end_quest_travel_thedome_1,It seems the historians have found a stash of unpleasant ritualistic knives used by the Cultists. I’m sure they’ll come in handy for someone like you...
message_end_quest_travel_theenclave_1,"The Mayor said that one of his dogs had a strange amulet around its neck, and wondered if it might help you work out what happened."
message_end_quest_travel_theenclave_2,"I’ve never seen it’s like before, but it seems to have some magical properties, so you might have a use for it?"
message_end_quest_travel_thehermitage_1,"He was rather apologetic, and has promised not to dabble in reanimation again, so I convinced him to change his line of research to alchemy instead .The good news is that he’s already started to supply me with a source of more powerful Mana Potions!"
message_end_quest_travel_thehole_1,"The Temple indicates two elemental focal sites in the surrounding areas, where the ancient Savvas set up altars to control the weather."
message_end_quest_travel_thehole_2,"It is likely you will find the Savvas at these locations, as well as where they are collecting their crystals from."
message_end_quest_travel_thehole_3,We should head to these locations and disable the altars. I’ve marked the locations on your map.
message_end_quest_travel_thehole_4,One of the archaeologists was so happy for the weather to have changed that she sent me an ancient shield she excavated last year. It looks to be in pretty good condition!
message_end_quest_travel_thepyre_1,"It seems that defiling the undead’s resting place was the cause of the haunting, and now they have been re-laid to rest. Military forces have left a small retinue guarding the keep again."
message_end_quest_travel_thepyre_2,The good news for us is that I know a Quartermaster who can get us a supply of Chainmail... just don’t tell his commander!
message_end_quest_travel_theshiftingsands_1,"I couldn’t resist the allure of a digsite full of rare and ancient artifacts. There was a lot more there than they told you, you know."
message_end_quest_travel_theshiftingsands_2,"I came across a very striking cloak, but I floated into the air as I put it on. It took me two hours to get down… and now I’m even scared of getting up on a horse!"
message_end_quest_travel_theshiftingsands_3,"You’ll never catch me dead in that cloak again, but I’m sure it has its uses. It’s in my store - just be careful putting it on."
message_end_quest_travel_thesloshedsquirrel_1,"The landlord was pretty happy when you arrived. Apparently the guests had run out of money, and had run up an almighty tab!"
message_end_quest_travel_thesloshedsquirrel_2,"He’s supplied me with some of his special stuff from the basement. It helps you hit harder, if you can remember what it is you are supposed to be hitting!"
message_end_quest_travel_thethorngate_1,"After talking to the villagers, it seems some of the children had entered the cave and stolen some magical artifacts the week before. This was a form of revenge."
message_end_quest_travel_thethorngate_2,"And so in retaliation, you’ve just gone in and killed all the Imps? Seems a little harsh..."
message_end_quest_travel_thethorngate_3,"So, err, let’s move on... I’ve now got some new boots in stock!"
message_end_quest_travel_toadmoor_1,"You inform the mayor of your findings and he is overjoyed, inviting you for a hearty feast in his manor."
message_end_quest_travel_toadmoor_2,"For a town as dull as Toadmoor, I’m surprised at the workmanship on the jewellery they’ve sent me. I reckon it’s magic too."
message_end_quest_travel_wayfarersrest_1,"I’ve managed to do a deal with one of the local Merchants to get in a stock of Minor Mana Potions, so hit me up for one when you have some spare gold!"
message_end_quest_travel_wayward_1,"Apparently, Wayward has had problems with localized storms for a few weeks now. They're are glad that you have found out the cause."
message_end_quest_travel_wayward_2,"It’s not the safest town in the land, but that’s probably why they make pretty good sets of Studded Leather Armor! Come check out my shop for a set."
message_end_quest_travel_wayward_3,"I’ve asked around, and apparently, a group of Savvas did come into town."
message_end_quest_travel_wayward_4,"They spent time visiting the Savvas Enclave in Wayward, but were quickly dismissed when they mentioned their plans."
message_end_quest_travel_wayward_5,"I've been told that they then headed east to Summerwell, with a few extra stragglers in tow."
message_end_quest_travel_wildspire_1,"I hoped that the town would reward us with some powerful weapons, but it seems they make fashionable jewelry for more alternative types."
message_end_quest_travel_wildspire_2,"That said, this earring does seem to have some magical properties."
message_end_travel_blackrockasylum_1,"As the Armoury was badly damaged, the Asylum passed me one of their bigger weapons."
message_end_travel_blackrockasylum_2,"Although why an Asylum needs a massive sword like this, I probably don’t want to know."
message_end_travel_boneshatterpass_1,The monks of Boneshatter Pass are overjoyed that the path has been cleared and have given me some of their fabulous footwear!
message_end_travel_mistfellcopse_1,One of the villagers from Mistfell Copse gave me an ancestral blade as a token of thanks. Take a look when you can!
message_rewards_quest_story_4a_1,"Ah, the joyous sound of gold coins in the pocket! But what to invest it in? Perhaps I should get some <nobr><b><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#F8F8F8>Minor Mana Potion</color></font></b></nobr>s back in stock..."
message_start_quest_boss_banditcommander_1,"The boxes recovered from the Mindthief’s nest contain some of the artifacts looted from the three Savvas shrines, but also from a fourth location."
message_start_quest_boss_banditcommander_2,"Look, this sigil here is clearly from the Shrine of Ashes. They have found it!"
message_start_quest_boss_banditcommander_3,That crate has markings from a shipping company out of Wildspire. I’d bet my hat the shrine is nearby!
message_start_quest_boss_banditcommander_4,But you don’t appear to be wearing a hat?
message_start_quest_boss_banditcommander_5,My Ma told me to never make a bet I couldn’t afford to lose!
message_start_quest_boss_highcultist_1,"Now the Spellweaver has the ‘boon’, whatever that is, we should plan the assault on the Cult headquarters."
message_start_quest_boss_highcultist_2,But how do we know where it is?
message_start_quest_boss_highcultist_3,The Sun Demon could have been trying to communicate. Perhaps where it burnt the map?
message_start_quest_boss_highcultist_4,"To the North of Bloodford, in the swamps? I guess that’s where we go then?"
message_start_quest_boss_inoxbodyguard_1,You now have both the location of the Traitor’s base and the means to get into it. Prepare yourself for fight!
message_start_quest_boss_jekserah_1,Has anyone tried maybe… slotting the two hemi-thingies together? Into a sphere?
message_start_quest_boss_jekserah_2,Intriguing… They fit together perfectly. The inscription has interlocked:
message_start_quest_boss_jekserah_3,"‘Your demise opens as a neck, but with the start of joy. It ends a Seraph, without the beginning of pride. Come forth, have your body join my employ, And see all who oppose the new queen subside.’"
message_start_quest_boss_jekserah_4,"Those drawings… they form a map! It leads to the Sewers of Demonsgate. Whatever that riddle means, I’m sure our thief and Demon conjurer will be there. Let’s go."
message_start_quest_boss_mercilessoverseer_1,Where was that side entrance on the cave plan again?
message_start_quest_boss_mercilessoverseer_2,"It opens out into a holding area, near the cave’s main chamber."
message_start_quest_boss_mercilessoverseer_3,Is there any chance that it could be a holding area for newly-kidnapped Vermlings?
message_start_quest_boss_mercilessoverseer_4,Maybe… Do you think the Sunkeeper’s key may be for that door?
message_start_quest_boss_mercilessoverseer_5,"It’s worth a try, isn’t it?"
message_start_quest_boss_sightlesseye_1,"The Nightshroud’s research is complete, he’s told me the origin of the rot will be the creature at its centre."
message_start_quest_boss_sightlesseye_2,That would be south near Obsidian Bluff then?
message_start_quest_boss_sightlesseye_3,"He also believes that these creatures partly communicate through excretions, and that it’s nest will only be revealed if we are able to replicate them."
message_start_quest_boss_sightlesseye_4,I don’t think I’ve ever heard anything so disgusting…
message_start_quest_boss_sightlesseye_5,"The Potion I have created from the Deep Terrors may help us here, we should head to Obsidian Bluff."
message_start_quest_boss_undeadcommander_1,"You know what, this angry skeletal chap sounds a lot like a certain hero that the Elementalist has been researching"
message_start_quest_boss_undeadcommander_2,"Swagger? So he did come back from the demonic realm, but then got trapped in Cursekeep?"
message_start_quest_boss_undeadcommander_3,"Hmm, sounds best if we head that way and investigate?"
message_start_quest_travel_keyport_1,"Right, time to take the battle to Keyport."
message_start_quest_travel_keyport_2,We'll send a small force by land while our allies go in via ship from the rear.
message_start_quest_travel_mudview_1,"There are too many troops to the north, we'll have to get help from elsewhere."
message_start_quest_travel_mudview_2,"I suggest contacting the Mayor of Mudview, she's always had a wise head on her shoulders."
message_start_quest_travel_rockfall_1,"With both temples out of action, the Savvas should now be vulnerable to an assault... if we could find out where their base is."
message_start_quest_travel_rockfall_2,"Hold on, I’ve just got a missive from Rockfall. They are under attack!"
message_start_quest_travel_rockfall_3,"Then the Savvas must be nearby, using their own abilities rather than the crystals."
message_start_quest_travel_shimmeringshallows_1,"We've got the troops and the weapons, but how do we get them to Keyport?"
message_start_quest_travel_shimmeringshallows_2,"A ground attack would be crazy, we need to get them in via sea."
message_start_quest_travel_shimmeringshallows_3,"Let's take the port at Shimmering Shallows, the Council won't expect that!"

“This,” he says, failing to mask his giddiness. “Is our master: the Gloom. It wanted to thank you personally for murdering so many of our brothers and setting back our plans.”

Out of the rift, a group of horrendous, bloated corpses appears and shambles toward you."

quest_campaign_030_desc,Is this Voice something you can trust?
quest_campaign_030_intro,"“So, there’s a disembodied voice somewhere deep in the Copperneck Mountains, and it wants you to collect vessels that will help it escape its confinement?” A bookish Quatryl at the University adjusts his glasses to look up at you. “And you want to know exactly what this voice is?”

He laughs nervously. “Heh, okay, well, I’ll do what I can. I’ll start with rituals that could separate a voice from its host...” The Quatryl sort of drifts off in the middle of his sentence and wanders over to some bookshelves, where he leafs through various texts.

You decide to head to the market for a few hours. When you return, the Quatryl rushes up with excitement.

“I’ve found it!” He waves a book in your face. “I hit a number of dead ends until I realized the voice wasn’t separated, it was just the only thing that can get through the barrier
created to imprison it, which implies that the barrier itself was extra-planar, most likely created by the Aesthers ages ago.

“So I did some digging through all the texts we have on Aesther rituals—which isn’t much, they’re very reticent about such things—but luckily I found this book. It is a specific recounting of the binding of a demon in the Copperneck region you referred to. Apparently the creature was so strong, the Aesthers enlisted the help of the Savvas and the Harrowers, too. They claim it was powerful enough to lay waste to the entire continent.

“If it’s asking you to help free it, I’d strongly recommend against it. The accuracy of the text is admittedly a little questionable, but whatever this voice is, it was bound for a
reason.”

The Quatryl finally stops waving the book around and begins to flip through the pages. “In fact, if you can hear the voice from outside the cave, and it has such a strong influence over you, it sounds as if the barrier is weakening, as the author warns.

“Apparently there is a scepter that could be used to strengthen the binding ritual, but the author says it has been placed on an island along the south shore for safekeeping. There’s a simple incantation detailed in the text to open the door to the shrine.”

Two days later, you stand before the ruined structure, which now sits half-sunk in the water-logged earth. You speak a few foreign words and the door creaks open. You get the strong sense that the door is not the only thing between you and this scepter."

quest_campaign_031_intro,"Hail rubs her hands in excitement.

“On this day, I can tell you that, for the first time, I do not regret turning you inside-out when we met,” she says matter-of-factly. “The Vessel of the Elements! And you say it was under my nose the whole time? Amazing how some things get forgotten so easily.”

She reaches out to touch it, but quickly recoils her hand. “Oh, so this is why you brought it to me? And here I thought it was a token of friendship.” She frowns.

“That,” she says, pointing at the artifact, “is a clear case of bad gifting. You’re going to have to clean this thing out before I can accept it.

“The artifact has been attuned to the Plane of Night, capable only of corrupting and destroying everything it comes in contact with. You could wreak a lot of havoc with this, but with such strong attunement, there’s no way to control its power. You’ll need to break the connection to balance it out.”

You stare at Hail blankly. “Oh, what, do I have to do everything?” she asks incredulously. “Okay, look, I’m not going to go in there and fix it, but I suppose I can transport your essences through to the other side so that you can sever the shadow link yourselves.”

Hail begins to move her hands fluidly back and forth. Occasionally a hand disappears down to her wrist, only to re-emerge, clutching colorful magics, which she begins to scatter over you.

“So it’s all very simple. Soon you will find yourselves in the Plane of Night. Just look around for a giant black pillar extending infinitely into the sky, and then destroy it. Once you do that, I’ll bring you back here.”

Before you even have time to object, your vision goes dark. At first you feel as though you are falling, but then realize you are standing on solid ground. Your vision adjusts, and you begin to see features in your surroundings. You are in a cave, covered in a slick, black slime. And there are demons—so many demons."

It’s a long, harrowing journey, navigating to the far side of the mountain, but eventually you find the hidden entrance.

“You will need to act quickly,” the creature instructed. “As soon as you enter, the Savvas will sound an alarm. You’ll need to get what you came for and get out before you are overwhelmed by reinforcements.”

Perhaps you may have enough time to return to the city and warn them.

You scramble up the cliffs of the elemental plane and jump through the rift. You race southward, hardly stopping to catch your breath. Eventually, thankfully, the Old River Gate on the north side of the city looms on the horizon. You approach with haste and summon the Captain of the Guard.

Not being a great fighter herself, she lived in an isolated crypt up the side of a mountain where she bred Drakes. Unbeknownst to her, the mountain was a dormant volcano and when it erupted she was never heard from again. The Trainer has tracked down an approximate location of the crypt to the South West of The Hole. You leave the mine workings and immediately see the volcano in the distance.

You could easily believe you’d never been here before, if you didn’t know better. The Summoner takes you off the path entirely once again, and into some undergrowth. She stops walking, again catching you off guard and almost tripping you up. She taps her staff into the grass and this time produces the spellbook you recovered. The Aesther flips it to a dog-eared page, and begins to murmur. Reflexively, her staff begins to glow. She points it at the ground, and in a burst of light a deep hole appears. The stink of Demon rises up almost immediately, and The Summoner jumps in soon after. You follow, unsure of what to expect..."

scenario_campaign_004_success_1,"It is clear that you have disrupted some sort of ritual here. These elemental demons belong on an entirely different plane of existence, but the cultists have somehow managed to pull them through to this one."
scenario_campaign_004_success_2,"On the altar in the back room, there is a wealth of scribblings on these rituals. Not all of the writing is intelligble, but you get the sense that this crypt is a place of power once used by an ancient civilization. "
scenario_campaign_004_success_3,"The ancients tapped the power of the elements to enhance their own lives, and while the exact fate is beyond your knowledge, it clearly didn't end well. "
scenario_campaign_005_success_1,"With the cultists and their minions dead, it seems the dark rift is now dormant. It is not less disconcerting, however. You toss a rock at it, and the rock disappears into nothingness."
scenario_campaign_005_success_2,You must admit that you wonder whether you could enter the rift yourself and whether you could survive the trip to wherever the rock ended up. 
scenario_campaign_005_success_3,"Alternatively, finding some way to close the rift is probably the more prudent decision. There is an Aesther enchanter in Gloomhaven who may know more about this inter-planar stuff. "
scenario_campaign_005_success_4,"She's been known to ask for impossible favours before she helps anyone, though. "
scenario_campaign_006_success_1,"After the terrible shrieks and moans of the undead, the sound of someone clapping is at once foreign and alarming. Turning around, you see a hooded figure standing at the edge of your torchlight. "
scenario_campaign_006_success_2,"You raise your weapon, but the grin on his silhouetted face isn’t menacing in a way that calls for arms. It is menacing in a way you’ve never experienced before."
scenario_campaign_006_success_3,"“Well done, sirs,” the figure lilts. “My, my, but you do have a way about you, don’t you?” And you’ve certainly gotten our attention now, removing this troublesome crypt of its rogue undead element. We very much prefer our undead to be the controllable variety, now don’t we?”"
scenario_campaign_006_success_4,"There is a long pause as the figure stares at you, still grinning."
scenario_campaign_006_success_5,"“Well, perhaps you’d be so kind as to do us another favor? After which we’ll be mostly settled on the whole issue of you murdering some of my brethren.” He stops grinning."
scenario_campaign_006_success_6,"“There’s a necromancer in Gloomhaven. Been giving us a spot of trouble, sending mercenaries out to do her dirty work against us. Maybe you’ve met her."" "
scenario_campaign_006_success_7,"“Kill Jekserah. Bring her head to our headquarters, and we’ll see about letting you live."""
scenario_campaign_007_success_1,"You pull up the last bush and hack away at its root. The grotto is still alive with many hostile creatures, but with your packs now full of biteroot, you make a quick retreat, eventually finding your way to the Stone Road and back to Gloomhaven and the Crooked Bone."
scenario_campaign_008_room_3_1,"Barreling through the gauntlet of storage shelves, traps, and undead, you finally make it to the back room of the warehouse, face-to-face with Jekserah and her two Inox bodyguards. "
scenario_campaign_008_room_3_2,"""So, you've decided to disrupt my plans instead of help me? You will regret that decision when I return to Gloomhaven with a legion of undead at my back!"""
scenario_campaign_008_room_3_3,"Moving with great speed, Jekserah turns and runs from you, flipping out of a window. You make a move to pursue her, but the two gargantuan Inox block your advance. "
scenario_campaign_008_success_1,"With the battle behind you, you look out the window and see no evidence of the fleeing Valrath. "
scenario_campaign_008_success_2,"You've stopped her plans for now, but after your brief conversation, it is clear that you need to hunt her down before she can make good on her threats. "
scenario_campaign_009_room_2_1,You move through a tight crawlspace clearly more suited to the ratlike Vermlings into a large chamber full of rubble and Vermling miners on high alert. 
scenario_campaign_009_room_2_2,"Toward the back of the chamber, a man in a dark robe cracks a whip and begins spitting orders at the miners, who turn their pickaxes away from the stone walls and toward you. "
scenario_campaign_009_success_1,"With the overseer dead and the diamond in your hand, you head back to Jekserah to claim your reward. "
scenario_campaign_010_start_1,"A booming voice fills the crackling air. ""Who are you to slay my servants and invade my realm? This affront will not go unpunished!"""
scenario_campaign_010_start_2,"Before you the energies in the air begin to form vague demonic shapes. To go deeper into this unearthly place, you must fight your way through. "
scenario_campaign_010_success_1,"As the final demon in sight screams and dissipates into the wind, you fall to your kness, thankful that the assault has stopped.  "
scenario_campaign_010_success_2,"""Very interesting."" The voice appears deep inside your head, clawing at your brain with its words. ""You interlopers are unexpectedly powerful. I could certainly use your expertise to find something in your own plane."" "
scenario_campaign_010_success_3,"The red rock below you rumbles and cracks, and a fiery fissure opens at your feet. ""I open my realm to you. Come, let me speak to you face-to-face."""
scenario_campaign_011_room3_1,"With the guards’ bodies in your wake stirring and rising as the undead, you knock through the fortress door. "
scenario_campaign_011_room3_2,"“Today we stand against the darkness!” The Captain of the Guard bellows at you, surrounded by soldiers. “To me! I will not let the city fall to this scum!”"
scenario_campaign_011_success_1,"The last of the guard falls, and once more you see a transformation of the bodies into soulless walking corpses. Jekserah steps through the doorway behind you.
"
scenario_campaign_011_success_2,"“You have done well, mercenaries—proved yourself in the face of these relentless pigs. With my bodyguards dead, you will be my new right hand, and we will rule over this city as it was meant to be ruled over. The last remnants of the old empire has finally fallen, and you should be proud."""
scenario_campaign_011_success_3,"“But there is still much work to be done. The merchant guild grows concerned about the declining quality of our water supply. We feel there may be some dark force at work below the sewers, poisoning the city."" "
scenario_campaign_011_success_4,"""I’ve also heard some talk behind closed doors of a dragon making roost in the Copperneck Mountains. Some merchants can be such children, but still, the reports are worth investigating. Whatever it is could be a threat to the city.”"
scenario_campaign_012_room2_1,"The waves of undead crashing against your weapons have finally subsided as you reach Jekserah’s manor and kick in the door. You see her in the foyer, shaking with rage."
scenario_campaign_012_room2_2,"“You will not defeat me! My army has been cut back, but the dead are fuel to my fire. My army is infinite and eternal!”"
scenario_campaign_012_success_1,"Jekserah collapses, the life fleeing her eyes. “I...” she whispers at you. “You have no idea what’s coming...”"
scenario_campaign_012_success_2,"""Infuriating."" The Captain of the Guard steps up behind you, wiping his blade on his tunic. “So much needless death, eating ourselves from the inside. At least it is over now.”
"
scenario_campaign_012_success_3,"He looks from Jekserah’s lifeless corpse to you. “Listen, you have proven yourself this day. Without your warning and without your strength, we would have been overtaken by the undead. If you’re interested, I may have some more work for you.""

"
scenario_campaign_012_success_4,"""First of all, we've had reports from the north about large flying creatures. People are afraid of dragons.” He shakes his head in annoyance. “I’d like you to head to the northern pass and investigate.""
"
scenario_campaign_012_success_5,"“Closer to home, however, there is some trouble brewing in the sewers below the Sinking Market. The wells in the area seem to be poisoned, and the sewers have become infested with snakes and sentient slimes, making further investigation difficult. I need you to discover the source of the poison.”  "
scenario_campaign_013_room2_1,"You open the door to the inner chamber, and more enemies materialize before you eyes. Flying red lizards, wailing spirits, and great, terrifying bears that don't seem at all happy to have been suddenly transported here. "
scenario_campaign_013_start_1,"""I know, I know,"" the voice says. ""You have questions, I have answers. Unfortunately, if you don't leave now, you won't have a head to ask the questions in the first place."""
scenario_campaign_013_start_2,You ready your weapons. There's no way you're going to climb back down that cliff with nothing to show for it. 
scenario_campaign_013_success_1,"As the last of the creatures falls, the temple becomes eerily silent. You call out, but the strange voice offers no response.  "
scenario_campaign_013_success_2,"You begin banging the walls with your weapons and yelling even louder, making it clear that you will not leave without answers."
scenario_campaign_013_success_3,"""ENOUGH!"" The power of the voice shakes the ground. ""I could easily kill you, you know. But normally a threat is enough to send you pathetic lesser beings scrambling."""
scenario_campaign_013_success_4,"""I don't necessarily like murder, however, so I will make you a deal. I will answer a single question for you, and then you will leave this place without further incident and never return."""
scenario_campaign_013_success_5,"""So what would you like? Great power? Great wealth? Or is the location of the necromancer you are hunting really that important to you?"""
scenario_campaign_014_success_1,"With the last of your adversaries dead, you approach the back of the chamber, where a small blue sphere floats above the floor."
scenario_campaign_014_success_2,"You slowly reach out your hand and find the orb cold to the touch. With a firm grip on it, the temperature is almost unbearable, but you quickly stash it into your pack and make your way back to the Crooked Bone."
scenario_campaign_015_success_1,"You rush forward and take hold of the sigil of strength lying on a pedestal in the inner chamber. Immediately an overwhelming
power surges through you and all of your foes disappear as quickly as they had appeared. "
scenario_campaign_015_success_2,"You feel a great strength welling up inside you. For an instant, your vision goes dark, and you see images of a strange runic alphabet."
scenario_campaign_015_success_3,"The power dissipates and your vision returns. You quickly write down the symbols that you saw, though you do not know their meaning.
[Insert Runes Here]"
scenario_campaign_016_room2_1,"With the pass blocked by the avalanche, you enter the cave to face your aggressors. Inside you see a network of passages leading deep into the mountain. "
scenario_campaign_016_room2_2,Perhaps they would be worth exploring once your foes are dead. 
scenario_campaign_016_success_1,"What were Inox and demons doing together? And so far north? You rifle through their belongings, looking for some indication of their motivation."
scenario_campaign_016_success_2,"All you find is some crude scratchings referencing a ""voice."" You glance toward the cave. There may be some clues farther down the tunnels.  "
scenario_campaign_016_success_3,"To the north, Icecrag Peak looms large in the distance. Still, you feel something calling you to explore the cave. Not audibly, but there is a subtle and powerful urge. "
scenario_campaign_016_success_4,"You look down at the Inox's scribblings. A voice—yes, somehow that sounds familiar. You can almost hear it yourself."
scenario_campaign_017_room2_1,"Who knew so many of these damned creatures could exist on such a small island? Entering their dwellings onboard the derelict ship, you see more emerge from the shadows. "
scenario_campaign_017_room2_2,"Along with them, however, you see the glinting of gold. This tribe has indeed amassed a great wealth in this ship."
scenario_campaign_017_success_1,"With the distraction of flashing swords and swiping claws put to rest, you investigate further to find great caches of gold below deck.  "
scenario_campaign_017_success_2,"Who knows what the Vermlings were using the gold for, but you have a good idea what you will use it for."
scenario_campaign_018_room2_1,"Navigating through the passageways, you find yourself in a large, open room with a cistern at the center. "
scenario_campaign_018_room2_2,"Around the cistern stand a group of Vermlings, who look up and snarl in your direction. This must be the cause of the poisoned water. "
scenario_campaign_018_success_1,"The Vermlings lie dead, their dark blood mixing with the pools of water on the floor. "
scenario_campaign_018_success_2,"Invesitgating further, you find no poisons of any kind on the corpses. Is it possible these vermin were not the cause and just living here, away from the eyes of the guard?"
scenario_campaign_018_success_3,"At the back of the room, large cracks are present in the wall, displaying a passage deeper into the depths. "
scenario_campaign_018_success_4,"And if you had some way to breathe underwater, you may even be able to enter the cistern and find the source that way. "
scenario_campaign_019_room3_1,"There is no rest among these cursed undead. As you kick through the door into the next room, you hear more commotion from the entrance. “There’s more of them behind us!”
Hail yells."
scenario_campaign_019_success_1,"Hail moves forward and grabs hold of the censer. She lifts it aloft and speaks a few words in an unknown language. Fire bursts forth and immolates the remaining undead, reducing them to ash."
scenario_campaign_019_success_2,"Hail breaks the smallest of smiles. “Well, now that that annoyance has been dealt with, let’s get on with the real fun. Show me to this rift of yours.”"
scenario_campaign_020_room4_1,"Jekserah has unfortunately had ample time to reanimate the corpses here, but they are no match for your skills. You knock down one last door to come face-to-face with the necromancer herself."
scenario_campaign_020_room4_2,"“I don’t know how you found me, but it matters little. You have mistakenly assumed that I ran because I was afraid to fight you. I was just holding out some hope that you would come to your senses in time."" "
scenario_campaign_020_room4_3,It is a pity that your minds cannot think beyond what is at the end of your blades. What corpses you have destroyed so far will now be replaced with your own.”
scenario_campaign_020_success_1,"Jekserah collapses, the life fleeing her eyes. “I...” she whispers at you. “You have no idea what’s coming...” "
scenario_campaign_020_success_2,"With one more hack of your blade, you separate her head from her body and hastily leave the wretched place full of mangled corpses. "
scenario_campaign_021_room4_1,"You lift back the veil of darkness to reveal the main room of the palace. In the center, you see the huge demon laughing. "
scenario_campaign_021_room4_2,"“You should have fled my realm while you had the chance, worms. In this place, you cannot possibly harm me.” "
scenario_campaign_021_room4_3,"He places a giant, clawed hand upon an altar of black glass in front of him. A swirling rift of chromatic energy emerges and pulses, bathing the demon in an aura of protection."
scenario_campaign_021_success_1,"With one final blow, the rift grows chaotic, spinning wildly and shooting tendrils of energy out at odd angles. A sharp whine emerges from it that increases in intensity until the sound echoes throughout the palace."
scenario_campaign_021_success_2,"In a brilliant flash of light, the void collapses in on itself and then explodes outward, sending a shock wave that destroys all demons in its path."
scenario_campaign_021_success_3,"As the wave hits the Prime Demon, his aura dissipates and a scream pierces your mind. His legs buckle underneath him and he collapses on the floor, crashing into countless shards of stone."
scenario_campaign_021_success_4,"As this happens, the screaming stops and the palace grows oddly quiet. With the threat destroyed, the only sensible thing left to do is loot the place and make your way back to your own plane."
scenario_campaign_022_room2_1,"Moving on from the entrance chamber, you find a large central room with many exits. In the center stands another group of cultists, preparing incantations around a reddish clay vessel, roughly the size of a skull."
scenario_campaign_022_room2_2,"“The artifact is ours, and it has made our minions more powerful than ever. You cannot hope to stop what is coming. Even if you strike us down, the Gloom will bring forth your end."""
scenario_campaign_022_room2_3,The cultists raise their hands and a barrier surrounds the artifact.
scenario_campaign_022_start_1,"""You’re too late, fools. We control this temple now, and all its power serves us."""
scenario_campaign_022_success_1,"With the altars smashed, the demons vanish and the protective barrier around the artifact finally dissipates. "
scenario_campaign_022_success_2,"You approach the center of the temple and reach out for the vessel but stop short. You feel a powerful darkness emanating from the thing, and behind that, a deep sadness."
scenario_campaign_022_success_3,"This artifact has been corrupted, and it seems to almost be cognizant of that fact. All of these feelings flash in your mind as a warning. It could be used for great evil. but would you fight for that evil or against it?"
scenario_campaign_022_success_4,"After some effort, you use a thick cloth to get the vessel into your bag. Perhaps it would be best to bring it to an enchanter rather than mess with it yourself. "
scenario_campaign_023_room2_1,You fight your way through the room of machinery and find corridors heading to your left and right. 
scenario_campaign_023_room2_2,"You hear the alarm ringing from both directions. To shut it off, you may have to split up."
scenario_campaign_023_success_1,"With the last switch depressed, the alarm finally, thankfully, subsides. The cannons’ lights go off and their guns point downward, lying dormant. "
scenario_campaign_023_success_2,"The machinery sputters and dies, the cogs stopping their rotation. Within a matter of seconds, the entire chamber becomes as dead as it was before, leaving you to continue to explore in peace."
scenario_campaign_023_success_3,"Heading down a narrow passage at the back of the left room, you find the corridor descends into a pool of brackish liquid. "
scenario_campaign_023_success_4,You can see a vague light in the distance under the water. A quick swim should take you farther into this underground world.
scenario_campaign_024_success_1,"The last of the fog dissipates and a wind immediately picks up, circulating throughout the chambers of the prison. Its speed grows rapidly, starting as a breeze and escalating to a cyclone in a matter of seconds."
scenario_campaign_024_success_2,And then you hear the Voice: a sound carried on the wind—a great and terrible sound. There is a powerful cry and all the remaining monsters are destroyed—disintegrated and scattered among the storm.
scenario_campaign_024_success_3,"“Thank you, my friends. It is good to finally be rid of those pests.” The Voice rattles your bones as it speaks. "
scenario_campaign_024_success_4,"“And now that that is done, I ask you to aid me again. I am still a prisoner here, trapped in the wind. In order to take a more corporeal form and leave this land, I require my vessels of power returned to me.”"
scenario_campaign_024_success_5,"You fall to your knees as the sound subsides, your head ringing from the vibration. The Voice just destroyed your adversaries as if they were nothing. You cannot imagine what it would be capable of if you were to give it more power."
scenario_campaign_024_success_6,"“Do not worry, I have no desire to bring calamity to your land. I only wish to be on my way, to be free and unencumbered by this plane."" "
scenario_campaign_024_success_7,"""I give you now a vision of where you can find the first vessel. They thought to hide it  from me, but I can see it as if it were right in these chambers.

“Please, bring it to me.”"
scenario_campaign_025_room2_1,"You get through the wolves, thankful that the snow didn’t slow you down too much. You assume the fight is over, but the screeching begins again, this time much closer. "
scenario_campaign_025_room2_2,You look through the white storm and see red shapes scurrying toward you.
scenario_campaign_025_success_1,"Everything within you wants to stop—to fall over and rest in the snow. But you know you wouldn’t get up. You know you would get torn to pieces by giant, red claws. "
scenario_campaign_025_success_10,"“Or, if you wish to be cliché,” the creature says with a sigh, “you could simply attack me. Slay the dragon, save the princess, and all that."""
scenario_campaign_025_success_11,"“Except I have no princess, and I’m not a dragon—just a drake who has lived a long time and does not wish to end his life today. So if you do attack me, I will fight back, and you will most assuredly die.”"
scenario_campaign_025_success_2,"So you press forward, beyond all reason. Until, finally, the drakes stop pursuing and the mountain summit is in sight."
scenario_campaign_025_success_3,"The wind calms as you approach the peak. It is a nice change from the torrent of biting pain that came before. The air is thin, but you are above the clouds now and so the weather is relatively peaceful."
scenario_campaign_025_success_4," It makes it very easy to see the giant, winged lizard perched atop a jagged boulder."
scenario_campaign_025_success_5,"“Welcome to my mountain, intrepid adventurers.” A gravelly voice booms forth from the creature, surprising you with its eloquence."
scenario_campaign_025_success_6,"“I hate to back you into a corner, but now that you have come to me, face-to-face, your options are unfortunately limited."" "
scenario_campaign_025_success_7,"""I am not particularly hungry at the moment, so I could be convinced to let you live, if you agree to help me in a small matter."""
scenario_campaign_025_success_8,"“A group of Savvas subdued me in my sleep and removed one of my flame glands, presumably to study."""
scenario_campaign_025_success_9," ""I cannot let this insult go unpunished and would greatly appreciate you taking it back from their city, killing as many of them as you can in the process.” The drake clacks its claws against its stone perch in anger."
scenario_campaign_026_room3_1,"Following the signs of corruption, you find your way into the final room of the chamber, hoping to finish off the rest of your
adversaries quickly. Instead, horror invades your mind as you view the scene before you."
scenario_campaign_026_room3_2,"Four water pipes stand vertically in the back of the room, clear conduits for the pumping of the city’s water. Attached to the pipes, however, are writhing black masses, poisoning the water running through. "
scenario_campaign_026_room3_3,"When you enter, some of the black mass drips down from the pipes, coalescing into the forms of small, bulbous imps with mouths full of teeth."
scenario_campaign_026_room3_4,"The horde of demons and undead isn’t exactly a welcome sight, either."
scenario_campaign_026_success_1,"By the time the fight is over, the walls and floor are a mess of black ooze. None of it is pulsating anymore, though, which is a step in the right direction."
scenario_campaign_026_success_2," A simple mop can clean the remnants, now that the dark presence has been removed."
scenario_campaign_026_success_3,"You approach the back wall and bemusedly wipe away some of the grime with your finger. Most of it comes off easily, but a chalky black streak remains."
scenario_campaign_026_success_4,"Curious, you take your sleeve and begin wiping the wall more vigorously, quickly revealing some sort of runic language. With enough cleaning, you find lettering covering the entire back wall."
scenario_campaign_026_success_5,"The letters are unrecognizable, but you jot them down and head back to town, bringing the writings to a language expert at the University."
scenario_campaign_027_success_1,"Hail screams out with hair-raising intensity. You look to her, afraid that more demons got past you and are attacking her. "
scenario_campaign_027_success_2,"Instead, you see her pulling her hand back out of the rift. Her forearm is withered and smoking. As her gnarled fingers clear the chaotic energies of the rift, it wavers and begins to shrink. "
scenario_campaign_027_success_3,"A great wind picks up in the chamber and the demons fighting with you show fear for the first time. Instead of digging their claws into you, they grab at the stone floor, desperate to stop the pull of the rift."
scenario_campaign_027_success_4,"Their efforts are futile, however. Every last one is sucked back into their own plane. The tear shrinks to one brilliant point and disappears."
scenario_campaign_027_success_5,"Hail collapses, and you run to her side. “Oh, don’t mind me,” she coughs. “I’ll be fine. This old body has seen far worse.”"
scenario_campaign_027_success_6,"She breaks into a fit of coughing, that soon turns into laughter. “That really was something, though, wasn’t it? If there’s one thing I can depend on you for, it’s a challenge."""
scenario_campaign_027_success_7,"“Here, help me up. I need to get back to Gloomhaven immediately. I have many new thoughts for my research. Feel free to come by any time and I’ll figure out some way to properly thank you.”"
scenario_campaign_028_start_1,"“You are worthless fodder!” The figure suddenly screams in exhilaration. “Did you think you could come back into our graces so easily?"""
scenario_campaign_028_start_2,"""You are here to die! Then you can join our cause as a corpse, just like the rest of these unworthy fools!”"
scenario_campaign_028_success_1,"You drop your weapons, exhausted. Thankfully, no more undead seem to be coming through the rift, but still, its existence and the presence of this Gloom is troubling."
scenario_campaign_028_success_2,"“You have done well.” A cold, low voice penetrates the silence. It seems to be coming from the darkness in front of you. “My minions may not be able to forgive. But I can."" "
scenario_campaign_028_success_3,“Come. Come to me. Step into my realm. Embrace the inevitable.”
scenario_campaign_028_success_4,"The rift stands before you. You can see this through to the end, or you can turn around and leave this place, ignoring the call of the Gloom."
scenario_campaign_029_start_1,"“There will be no last stand. You will simply waste away. You will die without valor in a foreign place and there is no recourse."" "
scenario_campaign_029_start_2,"""I leave you now forever. Good-bye.”"
scenario_campaign_029_success_1,"You bang on the walls, desperately hoping for something to continue fighting against in this exile. You grow tired. Your vision darkens."
scenario_campaign_029_success_2,"In your next breath, you find yourself lying in the grass outside of the cult’s hideout."
scenario_campaign_029_success_3,“Know that I have spared you.” The low voice returns. “Your persistence intrigues me. I invite you to break yourself against me. It will be more entertaining than the last time I brought gloom to this world.”
scenario_campaign_029_success_4,You bolt upright and rush back into the crypt. Dead bodies of the cultists litter the floor.
scenario_campaign_029_success_5,“I am not here anymore. These shells have served their purpose. My roots are now deep and you will soon encounter my endless power once more. I look forward to the day.”
scenario_campaign_030_success_1,"You grab hold of the scepter and the entire building shudders violently. A dark energy bursts forth, piercing through the chests of the monsters still attacking you. They all fall over dead and the shuddering stops."
scenario_campaign_030_success_2,"As you get back to your feet, however, a sharp pain suddenly pierces your skull. "
scenario_campaign_030_success_3,"“You have been misled,” the Voice speaks into your mind. “Do not bring that scepter to me! If you free me, I guarantee no harm will come to you."" "
scenario_campaign_030_success_4,"""But I cannot say the same if you approach with the scepter. Whatever you think you are doing, you are wrong.”"
scenario_campaign_030_success_5,"As quickly as it came, the pain stops. You tighten your grip on the scepter and race out of the shrine, eager to bring it to the Echo Chamber and silence the Voice."
scenario_campaign_031_room2_1,"Just as you are beginning to think that Hail sent you to the wrong place, you gratefully see the outline of a tower in the distance. "
scenario_campaign_031_room2_2,"The thing is massive, with twisting ropes of darkness weaving in and out of one another, reaching up through an opening in the cavern ceiling above you."
scenario_campaign_031_success_1,"With one last swing, the tower of black rope severs. The strands writhe and whip around, quickly ascending out of the cave, as if falling away up into the sky. "
scenario_campaign_031_success_2,"The ground shudders. Cracks form beneath your feet, and there is a loud grating noise as the whole chamber shifts and begins to crash downward."
scenario_campaign_032_success_1,"The Harrowers proved quite difficult to take down, but in the end they fell just like any other foe. "
scenario_campaign_032_success_2,"Feeling the rot of the place seeping into your bones, you hurriedly ransack the dwelling and locate the small earthen pot shown to you by the Voice."
scenario_campaign_032_success_3,"When you pick it up, the Voice fills your head. “Good! Yes, excellent! The infesters were but one guardian employed to block my passage. I give you now the second location. Please bring the vessels back to me. I will reward you greatly.”"
scenario_campaign_033_room3_1,You hear the alarm ringing clearly in the distance. You’ve kicked over a hornets’ nest and it’s just a matter of time before you are swarmed.
scenario_campaign_033_room3_2,You enter the inner chamber and scan the room. There’s a lot of treasure here. Best just to grab it all.
scenario_campaign_033_success_1,You round the corner just as a ball of fire flies in your direction. It explodes on the far wall and collapses the tunnel behind you. 
scenario_campaign_033_success_2,"You break into a full sprint and, within minutes, emerge from the mountain and continue speeding into the surrounding
foothills. "
scenario_campaign_033_success_3,"With a safe distance between you and your pursuers, you finally collapse to the ground and rest.  "
scenario_campaign_033_success_4,"After a while, it becomes clear that no Savvas are chasing you, so you get up and continue your quest with the treasure in hand."
scenario_campaign_034_success_1,"With one final blood-curdling screech, the giant drake falls off its perch and crashes to the snowy ground. It appears to still be alive, but its breaths are weak and shallow."
scenario_campaign_034_success_2,"“Bloodthirsty and obtuse. I don’t know why I should have expected more,” the drake whispers. “Congratulations on your stunning success."""
scenario_campaign_034_success_3,"""I’m sure you will be heralded as heroes upon your triumphant return. Adorned in crowns of gold and cloaks of silk. Riches will be laden upon you and five thousand...”"
scenario_campaign_034_success_4,The drake’s whispers trail off and the breathing stops. 
scenario_campaign_035_room2_1,"As you hack away at the wooden door, an explosion erupts from it, sending gouts of flame dancing among splinters of wood and shards of rock."
scenario_campaign_035_room2_2, A shock wave blows you from your feet and you recover to see nothing but billowing smoke where the door once was. The way is clear. Now it’s time to bring down the Captain.
scenario_campaign_035_start_1,"“Take my place at the head of my army. Crush this wall
and bring me that human’s head!”"
scenario_campaign_035_success_1,“Traitorous idiots!” The Captain spits blood in your face. “You’ve doomed everyone in this town! Why would you do this?”
scenario_campaign_035_success_2,"A shadow is cast over his fallen body. You look to see the tall, bleeding figure of the Prime Demon standing over him. "
scenario_campaign_035_success_3,"“Wealth, power, all the things you humans scrabble after every day of your miserable lives."" "
scenario_campaign_035_success_4,"""These mercenaries, however, were fortunate enough to find someone who would actually give it to them instead of making empty promises."""
scenario_campaign_035_success_5,“I will stay true to my word. Only those who opposed me will die. The rest are free to continue to live and toil in this place under my rule. I will return to my realm and plan my next move.”
scenario_campaign_036_room2_1,"With a terrifying roar, the great demon commander leaps forward from the back ranks and lands the final blow against the old gate. It buckles and gives way under his force. "
scenario_campaign_036_room2_2,"He seems winded, though, and is clearly very injured. If you can take him down, the whole attack force should be dispersed."
scenario_campaign_036_start_1,“That’ll teach him!” the Captain shouts at you. “Keep them at bay! I must head to the other gates and prepare for assaults there as well.” 
scenario_campaign_036_start_2,He grabs you with a firm hand. “Don’t let them through!”
scenario_campaign_036_success_1,"The demon bellows and falls, shaking the earth as it crashes down. Its clawed hand opens to reveal the artifact. "
scenario_campaign_036_success_2,"“I thought it would give me enough power. I thought it could sustain me on this plane. I was foolish, and now look at me. Broken and destroyed at the feet of mortals. Humiliating.” The demon gurgles and goes still."
scenario_campaign_036_success_3,"The Captain steps up beside you. “The rest of the force is dispersing,” he says. “It was unpleasant, but we prevailed, thanks to you.”"
scenario_campaign_037_success_1,"You press ever forward, leaving the wretched trench. Looking behind you, you see the figures of more Lurkers waiting in the shadows, but they do not pursue. Perhaps they are afraid of whatever lies ahead. "
scenario_campaign_037_success_2,"You go deeper through a crack in the earth until your path shifts suddnely upward. You emerge from the cold, unforgiving water into an air pocket deep beneath the waves. "
scenario_campaign_037_success_3,"You spit out your water-breathing orb, grateful to finally breathe normally and take a short rest. Through the darkness ahead of you, you see an expansive cavern, which houses a massive stone structure. "
scenario_campaign_037_success_4,"This unnatural sight, so far removed from anything you are familiar with, fills you with irrational, foreboding dread. "
scenario_campaign_038_success_1,"With the last of the Inox and their golems dead, the Orchid drops his sword and falls to his knees."
scenario_campaign_038_success_2,"“Thank you,” he says. “They killed my family when they came. They said my children were not strong enough workers.”"
scenario_campaign_038_success_3,"The Orchid dips his fingers in a pool of blood and begins to paint his face with it. “I thought killing them all would help, but I still feel hollow."""
scenario_campaign_038_success_4,"“I owe you a debt for what you have done. I will gladly lead you into the western forest. On the way, however, I would like to check on a neighboring Orchid village. I fear that this may not be the last of the slaving Inox tribe.”"
scenario_campaign_038_success_5,"The Orchid stands and turns to you, his face now a red mask of ferocity and hatred. “I am called Redthorn. Follow me.”"
scenario_campaign_039_room2_1,"As quickly as you can, you escape the rising storm of ice to find some semblance of shelter in a cave. With every step, the angry wind bites deeper."
scenario_campaign_039_room2_2,"There are more enemies in the cave, of course, but you are more concerned about the glowing white orb behind the crytalline demons. "
scenario_campaign_039_room2_3,"The pieces all start to fall into place. They are controlling the weather here, blocking your passage to the peak. If you can destroy the orb, you hope the punishing weather will subside."
scenario_campaign_039_success_1,Pieces of the shattered orb fall to the snowy floor along with the corpses of the enemies who stood in your way. 
scenario_campaign_039_success_2,The screeching of the wind outside the cave lessens to a faint murmur. You exit to see clear skies above you and a path to the peak.
scenario_campaign_039_success_3,"At this altitude, without a cloud in sight, you find yourself looking out over the horizon, marveling at the wondrous expanse of mountains and the forests and plains beyond
them. "
scenario_campaign_039_success_4,You can even see the faint outline of Gloomhaven in the distance.
scenario_campaign_039_success_5,"Looking to the west, your curiosity is piqued by a lake high in the mountains and a small stone structure resting at its edge. "
scenario_campaign_039_success_6,You make a note of the building—it might be worth investigating in the future.
scenario_campaign_043_success_1,"The waves of red-scaled lizards seem unending, but you have harvested a significant number of corpses and make a calculated retreat. "
scenario_campaign_043_success_2,"At the mouth of the cave, you break into a full sprint and the drakes don't seem too interested in pursuing you. You begin the strenuous task of lugging the hides back to the Crooked Bone. 

"
scenario_campaign_046_room2_1,"You make your way through the dark fog and find a small clearing at the summit. The screech once again pierces your ears, and a massive demon with a multitude of sharp claws and leathery wings lands before you."
scenario_campaign_046_room2_2,"""You dare approach my nest?"" You can barely make out the words from its high-pitched wailing. ""I will harvest your corpses and feed them to my children!"""
scenario_campaign_046_success_1,"The giant demon screeches one last time, its timbre and intensity modulating wildly as it spasms in its death throes. Not wanting to get close to its flailing claws, you wait for the creature to expire. "
scenario_campaign_046_success_2,"When it finally does, a stillness washes over the area and day once again breaks in the sky above. 
"
scenario_campaign_046_success_3,"The view is grand, apart from the blood and carnage that litters the peak. You take it all in and then slowly begin to make your way back down the mountain, satisfied that whatever evil was lurking here will no longer trouble Gloomhaven."
scenario_campaign_048_success_1,"The headless spectre screams as you land one final strike against it, and its form begins to dissipate, black wisps of smoke escaping from the cracks in its armour. "
scenario_campaign_048_success_2,"The giant warhose continues to stomp forward through the clearing, but it ages rapidly before your eyes. Grey hairs sprout feverishly out of its mane, and the horse shrinks as its muscles wane. "
scenario_campaign_048_success_3,"Before it even reaches the edge of the clearing, the horse falls over as its brittle bones give way, and with it, an empty set of rusted armour. Within seconds, the horse and its rider are reduced to dust. "
scenario_campaign_063_success_1,"The last of the Inox shrieks and collapses at your feet. Though less armoured than most Inox, this particular group made up for it with an almost otherworldly ferocity. "
scenario_campaign_063_success_2,"And fighting alongside demons? The thought is truly troubling. It seems the influence of these demons is growing, and you are grateful that you have at least managed to push them back in some small way. 
"
scenario_campaign_063_success_3,"And the treasure is nice as well, of course. You stow it in your packs and begin to make the long journey back home.  "
scenario_campaign_064_success_1,"Finally, a peace falls over the cavern and you take a moment to savor the calm. You'd love to spend hours here, so far removed from the rigors and annoyances of everyday life. "
scenario_campaign_064_success_2,"But the captain said he wouldn't wait long, and getting stranded here would certainly not be ideal. 
"
scenario_campaign_064_success_3,"You take one last moment to breathe it all in, then head back through the cave and jump into the underwater tunnel. Luckily the merchant ship is still right where you left it, so you row over to its side and get hoisted back on board.  "
scenario_campaign_065_success_1,"You don't even bother reading all of the scraps of paper you find lying around the mine. You simply stuff them into your pack as you kill all the creatures that stand in your way. 
"
scenario_campaign_091_room2_1,"Up ahead of you, more humans await, but your attention also turns to a disembodied, high-pitched wailing. "
scenario_campaign_091_room2_2,"""Prepare yourselves, boys,"" one of the loggers yells. ""Here comes another one!"""
scenario_campaign_091_room2_3,"You think he is talking about you until a ghostly a form materializes in front of you, all chains and volatile anger. "
scenario_campaign_091_room2_4,"It screams and thrashes around with a blind hatred for eveything near it. It, unfortunately. must be put to rest along with all these bandits. "
scenario_campaign_091_success_1,"The forest falls silent as the last of the loggers are killed and the spirits dissipate. No wailing, no chopping, just silence. "
scenario_campaign_091_success_2,"The Beast Tyrant walks out of the underbrush with a grim look. ""It is unfortunate that the spirits had to be banished from this place, but there was no helping it,"" he says."
scenario_campaign_091_success_3,"""The pain of the forest drove them mad. I hope one day this grove comes back, and with it, the means for my ancestors to find their way home.""
"
scenario_campaign_091_success_4,"""It may be a long time before I hear their voices again, but I will stay and protect this place as best I can. I thank you for your help. Without you, I fear to think what might have happened.""
"
scenario_campaign_093_success_1,"The spirits seem calm and the Lurkers have retreated. You have looted what you can from the ship and are very eager to sail back to Gloomhaven to get your feet onto warm, dry land. "
scenario_campaign_093_success_2,"You take one last look at the strange island and its impaled ship, then do exactly that."
scenario_campaign_094_room_4_1,"With the screams of dying Vermlings at your back, you approach the final nest. Many more of the creatures stand before you, baring their teeth."
scenario_campaign_094_room_4_2,"To the right of the nest, you see an orb of black glass on a crude stone pedestal. A deep crack runs through the glass, nearly splitting the orb in half, and you cannot help but feel you have seen it somewhere before."
scenario_campaign_094_room_4_3,"Equally unnerving is how out of place the orbs look in these dirty surroundings. And why is it here, when all the other treasure is supposedly in the pit?  "
scenario_campaign_094_room_4_4,You shake the questions from your mind and focus on the task at hand—killing Vermlings.
scenario_campaign_094_success_1,"The Vermlings and their animal allies lie dead at your feet, and you heft the cracked orb in your hand. "
scenario_campaign_094_success_2,"When you first saw it, it almost projected an aura of malevolence, but now, when you look at it up close, it seems much more mundane. "
scenario_campaign_094_success_3,"Not wanting to break it, you hold it against your chest and head over to the pit where all the treasure is supposedly located."
scenario_crypt_banditarcher_descr_0,You've heard rumours that this is where a group of Bandits train their Archers
scenario_crypt_banditcultist_descr_0,"Bandits have begun working with Cultists in the area, it needs investigating"

scenario_crypt_bossundeadcommander_descr_1,Undead fill the area around this tomb

scenario_crypt_corpsecultist_descr_0,"The stench of death permeates through this area, something is not right here"

scenario_crypt_undead_descr_2,"These tombs swarm with the undead, it is time to end their suffering"
scenario_crypt_undeadarcher_descr_0,Archers and Cultists working together... for what ends?
scenario_crypt_undeadcultist_descr_0,"Cultists have desecrated this ancient tomb, be on your guard!"
scenario_crypt_undeadcultist_descr_1,"A strange cult is the cause of the Undead in the area, clear this crypt out"
scenario_crypt_undeadcultist_descr_2,"Cultists are raising an army of the dead, they must be stopped"

scenario_forest_inox_descr_0,An underground network of Inox Warriors are hidden out in the Forest
scenario_forest_inoximp_descr_0,Locals speak of a glade of old stones in the forest generating strong magic
scenario_forest_inoximp_descr_1,Inox spellcasters have been invoking ancient powers in a nearby glade

scenario_forest_vermlingcamp_descr_1,"Feral Vermlings have made a camp here, be on your guard"
scenario_forest_vermlingcamp_descr_2,This woodland is home to a scurrying horde
scenario_forest_woodcutterraid_descr_0,"This logging camp was raided, but by whom and why?"
scenario_job_1_1_bandit_forest_start_1,"The Bandits seem ill-prepared for your visit, but they draw their weapons and prepare to defend themselves."
scenario_job_1_1_bandit_forest_success,"With the Bandits dead, you head back to claim your reward."
scenario_job_1_1_undead_bandit_crypt_start_1,"The Bandits send the undead forwards, but there aren’t enough of them to worry you."
scenario_job_1_1_undead_bandit_crypt_success,"Another gang of Bandits destroyed, but you feel as if they are becoming ever the more brazen."
scenario_job_1_1_undead_crypt_start_1,An unhealthily-coloured miasma fills this tomb. You realise getting this job done and back out to the fresh air would be wise.
scenario_job_1_1_undead_crypt_success,"The undead are gone, but the smell remains. Fortunately, removing that isn’t part of the job. You leave the tomb and head back to claim your reward."
scenario_job_aneyeforaneye_sm1_desc,All Heroes start Poisoned
scenario_job_aneyeforaneye_start_1,The first room has a number of Cultists ‘converting’ bandits to undead. The smell is terrible.
scenario_job_aneyeforaneye_start_2,"I knew Cultists were vile, but this turns even my stomach. Time to die!"
scenario_job_aneyeforaneye_success_1,"As the last enemy dies, the Bandit Archer falls to her knees, exhausted."
scenario_job_aneyeforaneye_success_2,Thanks for your help... at least I got my vengeance. Here is your reward.
scenario_job_callofthewild_start_1,"Entering the cave, you can still catch the scent of blood in the air as you pass down a corridor, the floor littered in half-eaten bones."
scenario_job_callofthewild_start_2,The passageway opens out and you see a strange collection of creatures living in the same space. Perhaps they have all learned to live closer together due to the advances of the settlements in the area?
scenario_job_callofthewild_success_1,"The cave is quiet now, the beasts are dead, and normality can return to the vicinity"
scenario_job_demonaltars_room2_1,"There, Demon Altars! Focus on destroying them – the Demons can’t stay in our realm without them."
scenario_job_demonaltars_room2_2,There’s a set of pressure plates here too. I’m sure you’ll find more Demon Altars once you trigger them!
scenario_job_demonaltars_start_1,"I hate Demons… so spidery… Thankfully, they do not naturally exist in our realm, and especially not in such numbers."
scenario_job_demonaltars_start_2,There is something allowing them in – you’ll need to find it and destroy it to curb this infestation.
scenario_job_demonaltars_start_3,Those pressure plates aren’t natural. I’m willing to bet that whatever is causing this is behind whatever they open!
scenario_job_demonaltars_success_1,"As the last Altar is destroyed, the Demons dissipate back into their realm. You are left alone in an empty room inside an empty cave."
scenario_job_demonaltars_success_2,"Those Altars were placed here, and hidden purposefully. I have a feeling this won’t be the only time you’ll be doing a job like this."
scenario_job_demonicdissent_sm1_desc,At the start of each round Light & Dark Elements are set to Strong 
scenario_job_demonicdissent_start_1,"As expected, you find Demons in the first room. What you don’t expect is that they are fighting each other! This must be the cause of the tremors."
scenario_job_demonicdissent_start_2,There are many Demons here. Use their disagreements to help you defeat them all.
scenario_job_demonicdissent_success_1,"Now the Demons have been defeated, the tremors stop. You can now go and claim your reward."
scenario_job_dungeonofmisfortune_start_1,"What a strange place, with magical enemies. You’ll have to move quickly to reach the treasure, but be sure to kill enough enemies on the way."
scenario_job_dungeonofmisfortune_success_1,A new item is always welcome!
scenario_job_fellhounds_room2_1,"Passing into a second clearing, you spot Cultists performing a ritual. So this is the source of the outbreak!"
scenario_job_fellhounds_sm1_desc,All Hounds have Poisonous Attacks
scenario_job_fellhounds_start_1,"The forest opens out to an area with an unpleasant sight: Hounds, feasting on bloated corpses. No wonder they are diseased."
scenario_job_fellhounds_start_2,"As you press forwards to kill the dogs, the corpses rise up. Necromancy!"
scenario_job_fellhounds_start_3,"Those dogs are not well, best try and avoid being bitten."
scenario_job_fellhounds_start_4,I think you might be stating the obvious there...
scenario_job_fellhounds_success_1,It seems the Cultists were using the hounds to spread a disease that turns people into the undead. It’s probably best if you torch everything here.
scenario_job_firecult_start_1,"Flame Demons, Spitting Drakes, Bone Rangers… these creatures could level entire villages! Don’t let anything leave alive!"
scenario_job_firecult_success_1,The air cools as the last Cultist is slain. A heretical weight feels lifted from this place. 
scenario_job_firecult_success_2,Cultists always seem to be doing something needlessly reckless. I doubt this will be the only group summoning monsters that you’ll come across. 
scenario_job_inox_vermling_forest_intro_01,It seems the attackers are arguing over the spoils. and you catch them entirely off guard.
scenario_job_inox_vermling_forest_intro_02,Strike fast while they are distracted!
scenario_job_inox_vermling_forest_map_intro,"You have been contacted by a logging company, complaining that one of their camps has been raided by an Inox tribe using Vermling mercenaries. The workers have all been killed and the company wants the camp cleared of intruders, and the attackers dealt with. You head to the location of the camp, and hear the excited chatter of vermlings and the gruff responses from nearby Inox. They are not prepared for an attack."
scenario_job_inox_vermling_forest_outro,"The camp is safe once more, and your work here is done."
scenario_job_inox_vermling_forest_sm1_desc,All Enemies start Disarmed
scenario_job_mindcontrol_sm1_desc,All Heroes start Muddled
scenario_job_mindcontrol_start_1,"As you step out, you notice none of the Bandits are moving. They do not react. You are about to investigate further, when the nearest one strains a whisper."
scenario_job_mindcontrol_start_2,"Run, run away. The Imps control us, we can’t…."
scenario_job_mindcontrol_start_3,"At that moment an Imp flies out, laughing. The Bandits suddenly react and charge into battle."
scenario_job_mindcontrol_start_4,"Take down the Imps, and surely the Bandits will stop fighting."
scenario_job_mindcontrol_success_1,"As the last Imp dies, the Bandits suddenly stop attacking you."
scenario_job_mindcontrol_success_2,"Thank you, we... we had no control of our actions. This bandit life isn’t for me no more, I’m going back to work in a pub!"
scenario_job_mysterious_maze_intro_01,"The room contains an array of enemies, with no rhyme or reason of how they exist together."
scenario_job_mysterious_maze_intro_02,"This is the work of magic: these creatures should be at each others' throats, but they all exist to test your skills."
scenario_job_mysterious_maze_intro_03,"Well, let’s kill them then!"
scenario_job_mysterious_maze_map_intro,"A curious letter has arrived at your headquarters, an invitation to take on the Maze of Mystery. Nothing else is included, just a location of the Maze and an explanation of the rewards. Intrigued, you head towards the location, and are greeted by an elaborate entrance to a crypt, what is inside you don’t know, but you decide to enter."
scenario_job_mysterious_maze_outro,The last adversary dies. The Maze has been defeated!
scenario_job_savvasaid_start_1,We are here. Help me reclaim this sacred place.
scenario_job_savvasaid_start_2,"You heard the Savvas: Keep them safe, and clear the animals out!
"
scenario_job_savvasaid_success_1,"With the animals dead or driven away, the Savvas solemnly hands you a coin purse. After a brief discussion they enter the temple, leaving you to go on your way."
scenario_job_savvasaid_success_2,It seems the Savvas are discovering more and more of their history around Gloomhaven. We should expect to hear from more Savvas that require our services.
scenario_job_savvasinfighting_start_1,"It appears these Savvas are fighting over which discipline is the most powerful, and are catching villages in the crossfire..."
scenario_job_savvasinfighting_start_2,"Luckily for us, they seem to be just as eager to fight each other as they are to fight you. Use this to your advantage as you drive them away!"
scenario_job_savvasinfighting_success_1,"As another Savvas falls, the others begin to retreat in disbelief. The local settlements are safe, for now."
scenario_job_savvasinfighting_success_2,"These Savvas’ pursuit of power led them to fight each other without regard for those they deem inferior, and it seems many of them feel this way. I don’t think this will be the last group of warring Savvas you encounter."
scenario_job_snakes_undead_map_intro,"You accept the job to clear a crypt of Giant Snakes, which sounds like a routine job. When you meet the landowner who offered the job, he seems a little vague about the actual problem: yes, there are snakes, but he’s cagey about anything else down there. He insists the job is just to clear an old crypt. You reluctantly agree and head to the area. The crypt seems normal enough from the outside, and as you head in, you see discarded snakeskin..."
scenario_job_snakes_undead_scenario_intro,The first room however explains his deception: the crypt is also swarming with undead.
scenario_job_snakes_undead_scenario_outro,"Snakes or Undead, as long as the pay is enough, we’ll kill anything."
scenario_job_thedjinnpalace_start_1,"These undead are going to spawn all night, so your objective is staying alive!"
scenario_job_thedjinnpalace_success,"The Tinkerer seems overjoyed with the data he has collected, and the local villagers will also reward you with some gold. A night well spent!"
scenario_job_thehaunting_start_1,"You follow the spirits down a winding passageway, until it opens out into a room, filled with a swarm of Demons."
scenario_job_thehaunting_start_2,"It seems that the Spirits will aid you in this quest, but one must survive for them to be able to finally rest."
scenario_job_thehaunting_success_1,"As the last Demon dies, the spirits dissipate, finally at peace."
scenario_job_thestoneman_start_1,The Bandits charge out of the forest. They have brought Hounds and Snakes!
scenario_job_thestoneman_success_1,"The remaining Bandits have decided their payday isn’t big enough after all, they’d rather stay alive, and so they retreat into the forest."
scenario_job_thevaultsofpus_sm1_desc,All Heroes start Poisoned
scenario_job_thevaultsofpus_start_1,You enter the crypt and see Cultists hastily trying to raise an army of undead... but apparently the family buried here were of the larger persuasion.
scenario_job_thevaultsofpus_success_1,"The crypt is safe once more. Perhaps in future, the owners might put a stronger padlock on the door. One can only hope."
scenario_job_twotribes_start_1,You arrive to the sounds of pitched battle. The confrontation has already begun.
scenario_job_twotribes_start_2,"There are a lot of troops on both sides, and the fight is taking place on multiple fronts."
scenario_job_twotribes_start_3,"You’ll need to both stay out of combat if you can, while continuing through the forest!"
scenario_job_twotribes_success_1,"The forest floor is littered with bodies, but you emerge triumphant."

scenario_puzzle_2d_02,"In real scenarios, for each <link=""Glossary_Attack""><b><color=#FADC99>Attack</color></b></link>, the character will draw an <b><color=#FADC99>attack modifier</color></b> which influences the damage dealt.

Rummaging through his belongings, you find a simplistic map on a goat skin, with charcoal lines marking the location of a hideout. Your next destination."

scenario_story_scoundrel_3_success_1,"The Inox army is now all but scattered to the winds. You could easily walk away with their spoils and see justice in that, but you are a woman of principles. The coward has apparently sealed himself in the inner chambers with a supply of food. You’ll have to find another way in, and you’ll need some help!"

scenario_story_sightlesseye_room_2_2,It seems we have finally found the source of the Rot.
scenario_story_sightlesseye_room_2_3,Let’s take it out!
scenario_story_sightlesseye_start_1,"I’ve never smelt anything so unpleasant before, we must be close."
scenario_story_sightlesseye_start_2,<thud>
scenario_story_sightlesseye_start_3,Let’s push through these enemies into the room ahead!
scenario_story_sightlesseye_success_1,"As you hit the Sightless Eye for the last time, it shudders and then explodes, showering you all with a foul-smelling goo."

scenario_story_soothsinger_2_start_1,Undead again. What are the chances of this happening twice?
scenario_story_soothsinger_2_start_2,"Let’s discuss this later. For now, we have some bones to break."
scenario_story_soothsinger_2_start_3,I’m detecting strong magic nearby. You’ll need to head to the other clearings and shut down whatever is causing the Undead to appear.
scenario_story_soothsinger_2_success_1,"As the altars are destroyed, the remaining Undead fall to the ground. The Cultists run off into the undergrowth, defeated."
scenario_story_soothsinger_3_room_2_1,"Demons & Undead, who are we up against?"
scenario_story_soothsinger_3_start_1,"As you step out into the clearing, a cultist seems surprised to see you."

scenario_story_soothsinger_3_start_3,The Cultist points at the Soothsinger as he shouts.
scenario_story_soothsinger_3_start_4,"Kill everything else, but we need that Cultist alive!"

scenario_story_spellweaver_1_start_1,You aren’t going to be able to investigate the area with these Imps around. You’ll have to drive them away.
scenario_story_spellweaver_1_start_2,"Also, it seems as if attacks, both yours and theirs, are more dangerous."
scenario_story_spellweaver_1_success_1,"Now the clearing is peaceful, you are able to search around for clues. You find a number of strange scorch marks on the floor, and deduce that powerful demonic summonings have occurred here."
scenario_story_spellweaver_1_success_2,"Behind one tree, you find a hastily dug grave. Inside is the body of Bandit, seemingly torn to shreds by talons."
scenario_story_spellweaver_2_room_3_1,And more Demons! Why do people think they can control Demons?
scenario_story_spellweaver_2_sm1_desc,Characters attacking Cultists gain Disadvantage
scenario_story_spellweaver_2_start_1,"So, these Bandits are working with a Cult. Why am I not surprised?"
scenario_story_spellweaver_2_success_1,It seems someone at the top of this Cult has access to some very powerful summoning magic. The only way to restore balance is to take them down.
scenario_story_spellweaver_2_success_2,"I feel, however, that currently they may just be too powerful for us to be victorious. We need help..."

scenario_story_spellweaver_3_start_3,"‘But first, you must prove you have power within. Defeat the enemies without the Elements to guide you.’"
scenario_story_spellweaver_3_start_4,Something has locked off access to all elements in this tomb. This will be a very dangerous fight!
scenario_story_spellweaver_3_success_1,"As the last enemy falls, the voice booms out once more."
scenario_story_spellweaver_3_success_2,"‘You have been judged worthy. When you are at your hour of need, I will grant your boon.’"
scenario_story_summoner_1_room2_1,I suppose Wind Demons explain that odd smell…
scenario_story_summoner_1_room2_2,"There must be a Demon Altar nearby. Destroy it, and we’ll likely find what the Summoner sensed on our way out."
scenario_story_summoner_1_room3_1,There’s no altar… Focus on finding an exit. We’ll come back with a plan.
scenario_story_summoner_1_room3_2,This altar-less rift must be that plane disturbance thingy. Make sure you escape with all my expensive gea- I mean your lives.
scenario_story_summoner_1_room3_3,Watch your back: the Demons will follow you out.
scenario_story_summoner_1_start_1,"You’d think we would have found every creepy Fire Demon-infested dungeon in Gloomhaven by now, right?"
scenario_story_summoner_1_start_2,"Especially ones with collapsing entrances. Find a new exit, and watch out for those traps. It looks like they were meant to keep something inside."

scenario_story_summoner_2_room3_2,Hang on. Am I the only one who finds it strange that all of this city fits inside the rotting building we saw outside?
scenario_story_summoner_2_room3_3,I learned not to ask questions in this profession a long time ago..
scenario_story_summoner_2_start_1,There’s no way I’m going near a Harrower. Why are you following one?!
scenario_story_summoner_2_start_2,"I think the Summoner, er, summoned it. I’m sure she has a plan."
scenario_story_summoner_2_start_3,"If that oversized bug is part of this “plan”, keep it safe. The other things in this library seem to want to kill it as much as they want to kill us."
scenario_story_summoner_2_success_1,"With the room safe, the Harrower that led you here disintegrates into a cloud of insects. The Summoner gives you a stern look."
scenario_story_summoner_2_success_2,"After a short while, it reforms holding a battered book. The Summoner takes the book, and engulfs the Harrower in energy from her staff. When the light fades, it’s gone."

scenario_story_summoner_3_start_1,It would appear the Summoner has led you straight into the dungeon chamber where the rift resides.

scenario_story_summoner_3_start_3,The Summoner has started a spell of holding to close the rift. You’ll need to stay close by until it finishes - it will take time.
scenario_story_summoner_3_start_4,And maybe don’t die? There seem to be more Demons in here than last time!
scenario_story_summoner_3_success_1,"The Summoner’s body ignites a bright, pale purple and bathes the room. When the glow dims, the Demons and the rift are no more."

scenario_story_sunkeeper_2_success_2,Pasted to the wall is a large map of the realm and a big red X is marked on it.

scenario_story_sunkeeper_3_start_2,‘Your confidence will be your undoing… Kill them all!’
scenario_story_sunkeeper_3_start_3,"I don’t know who that was, but the route we came in from is blocked."
scenario_story_sunkeeper_3_start_4,Our best bet is to kill the Harrowers in charge and get out of here!
scenario_story_sunkeeper_3_success_1,"As you leave this place, the Sunkeeper waves something in her hand, apparently she grabbed something off a Harrower as it died.

scenario_story_tinkerer_1_room_4_2,That chest might hold what you need?
scenario_story_tinkerer_1_start_1,"Although this cave is now home to wild animals, you see scorch marks and damage that seems to be of a magical nature. Perhaps this is the right place."
scenario_story_tinkerer_1_start_2,"Best to search out the cave, and see if there is anything to find."
scenario_story_tinkerer_1_success_1,"As well as containing a small pile of ancient coins, the chest has a number of old scrolls. The Tinkerer takes these away for research."
scenario_story_tinkerer_2_room_2_1,"The doorway leads into the ruined temple you expected to find, and here you see more Cultists. They have activated some ancient defence systems!"

scenario_story_tinkerer_2_start_3,"Gah, too late. Kill them, quickly!"
scenario_story_tinkerer_2_start_4,"Clearly the Cultists are in charge here, I reckon if you kill them, the Bandits will soon disperse!"
scenario_story_tinkerer_2_success_1,"As the Last Cultist dies, the Golems deactivate immediately and any remaining Bandits head off into the undergrowth. Finally, you are able to look around the temple at your leisure."
scenario_story_tinkerer_2_success_2,"There is a wealth of information here. These documents describe how to control the elements, and how to open portals to the demonic realms. It is all heresy."

scenario_story_tinkerer_3_start_1,Something seems different about this Sun Demon: it is aggressive towards the Night Demons. Perhaps we can communicate with it?
scenario_story_tinkerer_3_start_2,"It still seems to be aggressive towards us, so try and keep the Night Demons off it. Infusing Light should help it stay alive."
scenario_story_tinkerer_3_start_3,"I should be able to close these portals in a short time, keep it alive until then."
scenario_story_tinkerer_3_success_1,"The dark portals blink out of existence, and the Night Demons disappear along with them. With the threat gone, the Sun Demon becomes more passive."

scenario_story_undeadcommander_success_1,"With a scream, the remains of Swagger fall to dust on the ground, it seems the Soothsinger now has nothing to fear."
scenario_travel_amberhill_start_1,Closed to outsiders? Who do they think they are?
scenario_travel_amberhill_start_2,"Well, I guess we know why the traders never came back..."
scenario_travel_amberhill_start_3,"They clearly aren’t going to let you go. Take them down, and then we can investigate further."
scenario_travel_amberhill_success_1,"With the Militia dead, the townspeople begin to emerge from their homes."
scenario_travel_amberhill_success_2,The villagers have told me that this Militia came to Amberhill from Millpond. That town could be in even more trouble… we should head there next.
scenario_travel_blackrockasylum_room_2_1,"This room has more escapees, but you hear the sound of combat coming from behind the next door."
scenario_travel_blackrockasylum_room_2_2,Maybe someone else is helping round up the criminals.
scenario_travel_blackrockasylum_room_2_3,"There is Rubble everywhere in here. Careful, it’ll slow you down."
scenario_travel_blackrockasylum_room_3_1,More Demons! These ones are capable of creating the tremors in the area!
scenario_travel_blackrockasylum_room_3_2,It looks as if you may be able to use the remaining escapees to help take them down.
scenario_travel_blackrockasylum_start_1,"We’re not going back in there, you’ll have to kill us first!"
scenario_travel_blackrockasylum_start_2,I guess you’ll have to do what the man says.
scenario_travel_blackrockasylum_success_1,"As the Earth Demons fall back to rubble, workers from the asylum come to take away the bodies of those that tried to escape."
scenario_travel_blackrockasylum_success_2,In the corner of the chamber you find some more of the strange crystals.
scenario_travel_bloodford_room_2,"The smell is worse in here, there are even more of them!"
scenario_travel_bloodford_start_1,"Well this stench can only mean one thing: Living Corpses! They are big and hit hard, but boy are they slow."
scenario_travel_bloodford_start_2,"Oh, they also have a fondness for vomiting... Keep on your toes and hit them from range and you should be fine."
scenario_travel_bloodford_success,"The last of the Undead falls to the floor, and the curse on this place is lifted. "

scenario_travel_boneshatterpass_room_2_4,We say No More!
scenario_travel_boneshatterpass_room_2_5,I can feel the power of the crystals emanating from nearby rooms. Your task is to destroy them. Try not to be distracted with this Savvas!
scenario_travel_boneshatterpass_start_1,You awake on the floor of a chamber. Demons are advancing towards you.
scenario_travel_boneshatterpass_start_2,"You’ll need to press forwards, there is no way back here!"
scenario_travel_boneshatterpass_success_1,"As the last Crystal is smashed to pieces, the Demons dissipate, and any remaining Savvas flee."
scenario_travel_boneshatterpass_success_2,One step closer to destroying this Savvas sect!
scenario_travel_crystalhollow_room2_1,Lurkers again? Why are they so interested in our water?
scenario_travel_crystalhollow_room2_2,"Whatever it is, they aren’t going to get it for free!"
scenario_travel_crystalhollow_room2_3,"You’d try and sell anything, I mean, water IS free!"
scenario_travel_crystalhollow_room2_4,"Stick it in a flask, put a name on it, and idiots will buy anything!"
scenario_travel_crystalhollow_room4_1,Would you look at all of that Rot?
scenario_travel_crystalhollow_room4_2,"Why would I, when I can smell it?"
scenario_travel_crystalhollow_room4_3,"You know the drill. If we clear the area of enemies, the Rot should stop polluting the water."
scenario_travel_crystalhollow_room4_4,And then we’ll never come back?
scenario_travel_crystalhollow_room4_5,And then we’ll work out where the creatures came from. And then we’ll never come back.
scenario_travel_crystalhollow_start_1,Look at all of those horrible Oozes… I can’t wait until we get rid of this blasted Rot!
scenario_travel_crystalhollow_start_2,"At least they’re not stone golems, right?"
scenario_travel_crystalhollow_start_3,Stop. Don’t even say those words.
scenario_travel_crystalhollow_success_1,"As the last Ooze dribbles into a puddle, the Rot around the cave crumbles away and the water clears."
scenario_travel_crystalhollow_success_2,"But the rotten stench stays, and streaks of black are still visible in the water..."
scenario_travel_crystalhollow_success_3,"It appears this wasn’t the source. We’ll have to travel further south, and hopefully we’ll learn of the Lurkers’ plans on the way."
scenario_travel_demonspinehollow_start_1,"As you pass through a clearing, hounds burst out of the undergrowth followed by high pitched laughing. It seems the villagers were right!"
scenario_travel_demonspinehollow_start_2,Imps! We never believed the elders of my clan when they said they used to deal with fairies.
scenario_travel_demonspinehollow_start_3,"The world must be in dire straights if they have become this brazen. Beware their magic, an Imp’s curse is not to be taken lightly!"
scenario_travel_demonspinehollow_start_4,"Also, some scenarios have branching paths. In this case it seems there are two routes. Ensure you always investigate all doors - you may need to split the party."
scenario_travel_demonspinehollow_success,"With the Imps and Hounds dead, the colours of the forest return to normal, and you head on towards the village."
scenario_travel_drakefirefarm_start_1,"I’ve been hearing rumours of Night Demons prowling areas to the north, but this is the first time I’ve seen them in the flesh."
scenario_travel_drakefirefarm_start_2,"They use the power of the Dark, Light will help you defeat them!"
scenario_travel_drakefirefarm_start_3,"Or cold, hard steel... but beware, they give all attackers disadvantage on their attacks!"
scenario_travel_drakefirefarm_success_1,"I hate those things, they're like overgrown spiders... why do they have so many arms?"
scenario_travel_drakefirefarm_success_2,"More arms mean more claws, and more claws means more killing."
scenario_travel_drakefirefarm_success_3,"That was a rhetorical question, but thanks, I’ll sleep soundly tonight..."
scenario_travel_eaglecrest_start_1,"Ah, what these friendly Inox didn’t inform us was that the Demons have bent the local Forest Imps to their cause. This will be an unpleasant fight."
scenario_travel_eaglecrest_success_1,"With the Demons dead, the Imps in the area flee and the Inox begin returning to their homes."
scenario_travel_eaglecrest_success_2,"I’d hope that’s the last we’ll see of the Sun Demons, but I know that won’t be the case."
scenario_travel_eastgrove_room_3,"Here are where the last of the Cultists reside. Kill them, and the creatures should dissipate."
scenario_travel_eastgrove_start_1,"The cavern is guarded by Demons and Spirits, but you must venture forth to help the inhabitants of Eastgrove."
scenario_travel_eastgrove_success_1,"As the final Cultist dies, their hold over the Demons and Spirits are broken, and the Crypt falls silent."
scenario_travel_fordingbridge_room_3_1,"This deeper part of the cave is certainly hotter than the others, with molten areas of rock on the walls."
scenario_travel_fordingbridge_room_3_2,"Careful, it looks like some of the floor is super-heated and dangerous.."
scenario_travel_fordingbridge_room_3_3,"Avoid it yourself, but it can be used like traps to injure or kill any non-flying enemies!"
scenario_travel_fordingbridge_room_4_1,Demons! What are these ones though? They seem entirely created from fire!
scenario_travel_fordingbridge_room_4_2,I have read of these. Flame Demons. They have not been seen in these parts before... what has brought them here?
scenario_travel_fordingbridge_start_1,"The initial cavern you enter feels similar to many you have seen before, although the colours feel a little strange."
scenario_travel_fordingbridge_start_2,"As you investigate, you disturb a number of creatures that live here. You’ll need to dispatch them and head into a deeper part of the hillside."
scenario_travel_fordingbridge_success_1,"With the Demons dead, the lava begins to cool. You also find some of those mysterious crystals scattered around the cavern."
scenario_travel_fordingbridge_success_2,Someone or something is using these crystals to sow chaos across the land... but why?
scenario_travel_hammerholm_start_1,"You enter the tomb and see hooded figures performing rites… Cultists! No, they carry swords and shields, Bandits…"
scenario_travel_hammerholm_start_2,"These Bandits have access to powerful magic, I can see they have opened portals through which necromantic energies are flowing."
scenario_travel_hammerholm_start_3,"Ignore the undead if you can, you must kill all the Bandits to stop the rite!"
scenario_travel_hammerholm_success_1,"With the magic users dead, the portals close and the undead turn to dust."
scenario_travel_hammerholm_success_2,"Their power is extinguished, and their hold on this town broken!"
scenario_travel_houndhill_room2_1,"Whew, I can’t believe something that ugly actually has friends."
scenario_travel_houndhill_room2_2,"We can’t let any escape, you’ll have to take them all out!"
scenario_travel_houndhill_start_1,That Harrower seemed to be in command of these soldiers…
scenario_travel_houndhill_start_2,Wow. Imagine being bossed around by a cloud of bugs!
scenario_travel_houndhill_start_3,"But it also seems to be alone here. If you can kill this one too, we may learn more about what it's doing here."
scenario_travel_houndhill_start_4,You’d also likely break up this merry little gathering!
scenario_travel_houndhill_success_1,"As the last cloak falls to the ground, the soldiers around you begin to pull back."
scenario_travel_houndhill_success_2,Harrowers commanding Milita? We may be in grave danger...
scenario_travel_houndhill_success_3,"There’s always some grave danger in this damn place! Where’s the fluffy danger? The harmless, fluffy danger?"
scenario_travel_ironbell_room2_1,"Well, I guess Drakes and Hounds explain a smell that bad. But I was banking on the Harrowers… or my ex."
scenario_travel_ironbell_room2_2,"Choose your moves carefully, these are tough enemies!"
scenario_travel_ironbell_start_1,They intercepted us before we reached Ironbell. We can’t let them reach those forges.
scenario_travel_ironbell_start_2,"You know, for a bunch of bugs under a cloak, Harrowers move pretty damn fast."
scenario_travel_ironbell_start_3,"However fast they are, they don’t look like they came prepared for a proper fight. You should be able to push them back from the city."
scenario_travel_ironbell_success_1,"As the last soldier falls, silence returns to the walls of Ironbell."
scenario_travel_ironbell_success_2,"Ironbell is saved, and has pledged to arm our mercenaries. We just need a way to get them into Keyport now."
scenario_travel_ironbell_success_3,I can’t wait to go and tell this Council how bad their name is.
scenario_travel_ironwoodcamp_start_1,"It sounds as if the forest itself is alive, the cracks of branches and snaps of twigs coming from all around you. You are surrounded!"
scenario_travel_ironwoodcamp_start_2,"I’ve no idea what’s got all these creatures so angry, but I think you are going to need to kill a decent number to drive them away!"
scenario_travel_ironwoodcamp_success_1,"As another creature falls, the remaining beasts turn tail and flee, and the forest is silent again. You wonder if it is permanent."
scenario_travel_ironwoodcamp_success_2,"Well, the job is done. Hopefully they won’t return."
scenario_travel_kailej_room2_1,"I would quite like it if Deep Terrors stayed in the deep, DEEP sea!"
scenario_travel_kailej_room2_2,I’m considering filling in the sewers under Demonsgate...
scenario_travel_kailej_room2_3,We have plumbing!? I always went outside…
scenario_travel_kailej_room2_4,...We’ll discuss that later.
scenario_travel_kailej_start_1,This seems just like the situation at Sweetwater.
scenario_travel_kailej_start_2,"With these Inox, though, it might just be a fair fight. As long as we don’t go near the sewers."
scenario_travel_kailej_start_3,Take back this settlement. You know what to do.
scenario_travel_kailej_success_1,"The last Deep Terror recedes back into the sewer in pain, and the Inox shout their victory. They commend your bravery."
scenario_travel_kailej_success_2,"Kailej’s chieftain says the river’s source is at Crystal Hollow, up in the mountains."
scenario_travel_kailej_success_3,"If we promise to destroy the birthplace of this Rot, he’ll stop anything following us there. Sound good?"
scenario_travel_keyport_room2_1,There’s the last artillery emplacement!
scenario_travel_keyport_room2_2,We cannot allow the Council’s work to fail. Kill them!
scenario_travel_keyport_room3_1,"Oi, someone order some crushed bugs?"
scenario_travel_keyport_room3_2,There’s your reinforcements. Now push to the Council!
scenario_travel_keyport_room5_1,Those are the doors to the City Hall. Push through!
scenario_travel_keyport_room5_2,"Yes, just battle that Stone Golem as well as all these friendly Militia soldiers. Easy."
scenario_travel_keyport_room6_1,There’s just a few Harrowers here!? This council actually was bug-brained…
scenario_travel_keyport_room6_2,Why do you fight the Council of Shadow? We are bettering you all!
scenario_travel_keyport_room6_3,Clear out this hive. I fear there is more to this.
scenario_travel_keyport_start_1,"You’ve been discovered, but no matter. You need to destroy this artillery."
scenario_travel_keyport_start_2,Let’s just hope this is all the Militia will throw at you… I’ve seen enough Stone Golems for a lifetime.
scenario_travel_keyport_start_3,"Either way, you wouldn’t be the one fighting them."
scenario_travel_keyport_start_4,"Yes, but they’re scary!"
scenario_travel_keyport_success_1,"The last Harrower dies, and an uneasy silence falls over the scenes of carnage around Keyport."
scenario_travel_keyport_success_2,"It is quickly interrupted by a banging from inside the City Hall. Investigating, you find the Keyport Elders, tied up inside their office."
scenario_travel_keyport_success_3,"The Keyport Council told me that Harrowers from The Council of Shadow came from Staybright Fort, and placed their own soldiers into Keyport’s City Guard."
scenario_travel_keyport_success_4,"The Council of Shadow, eh? That name is even worse."
scenario_travel_keyport_success_5,"Whoever they are, we’ll have to dig them out."
scenario_travel_lowtown_sm1_desc,"At the Start of each round, the Earth Element is set to Strong"
scenario_travel_lowtown_start_1,"You find the source of the power, a number of ancient stones which the Imps and Vermling Shaman are using in a ritual."
scenario_travel_lowtown_start_2,This will surely end very badly for Lowtown if you don’t drive the Imps away.
scenario_travel_lowtown_start_3,"Earth Magic is strong here, and will always be available at the start of the turn. Use this to your advantage!"
scenario_travel_lowtown_success,"As the last enemy falls, the pressure in the air immediately abates, the light returns to normal. and the insects of the forest start up again. Your work here is done."
scenario_travel_millpond_room3_1,"There’s the Artillery! Give it all you’ve got, and get out of there!"
scenario_travel_millpond_room3_2,"Protect this equipment with your lives, men! The Council demands it!"
scenario_travel_millpond_start_1,All this equipment… Why would Keyport put this much money into military ordnance outside its own walls?
scenario_travel_millpond_start_2,The artillery should be deeper in town. You’ll have to fight your way to it.
scenario_travel_millpond_start_3,"Without the Artillery, the Militia should lose morale and retreat!"
scenario_travel_millpond_success_1,"You escape with your lives, leaving the artillery a pile of scrap in your wake."
scenario_travel_millpond_success_2,"Good job. Without that artillery, it looks like the troops in Millpond are pulling back. The town will be free again."
scenario_travel_millpond_success_3,"Won’t Keyport’s defenses be a little more… prickly? They’ll be protecting their damn council, after all."
scenario_travel_millpond_success_4,"There is no way we can get through defenses like that into Keyport. We’re going to need more troops, and I might know just where to find them..."
scenario_travel_mistfellcopse_start_1,The clearing outside the cairns has Demons waiting for you... but there are no Savvas.
scenario_travel_mistfellcopse_start_2,There are two chambers to explore. You may need to split up if you want to complete the dungeon quickly enough.
scenario_travel_mistfellcopse_start_3,"Yes, it looks like there may be crystals in both directions."
scenario_travel_mistfellcopse_success_1,"With the Altars destroyed and Savvas defeated, any remaining Demons dissipate."
scenario_travel_mistfellcopse_success_2,"Once the two sites are cleansed, the Savvas will be badly weakened."
scenario_travel_mudview_room2_1,Focus on those Demon Altars - a lack of Demons will make mopping up the Cultists easier!
scenario_travel_mudview_room2_2,"After that, the door ahead looks like a shortcut out."
scenario_travel_mudview_room3_1,Oh... Not really a shortcut.
scenario_travel_mudview_room3_2,"Nope. Just Militia and… wait, what is that? A floating cloak?"
scenario_travel_mudview_room3_3,You are a fool for resisting the Council and their gifts!
scenario_travel_mudview_room3_4,"It’s a Harrower, what's that doing here?"
scenario_travel_mudview_start_1,These Cultists have been proving to be a real problem for the town.
scenario_travel_mudview_start_2,I was wondering how people running around in bathrobes were such a nuisance… but the Demons explain it.
scenario_travel_mudview_start_3,"Clear them out, and the mayor will agree to fight with us."
scenario_travel_mudview_success_1,"As the Harrower is slain, its body disintegrates into a cloud of insects. "
scenario_travel_mudview_success_2,I haven’t seen many Harrowers this deep in human territory...
scenario_travel_mudview_success_3,It seemed to be working for that dodgy council… talk about corrupted politicians.
scenario_travel_mudview_success_4,"Whatever it was doing here, it spooked the mayor into providing supplies and safe routes to help us attack Keyport."
scenario_travel_nasitra_sm1_desc,All Enemies start Disarmed
scenario_travel_nasitra_start_1,"Looks like you’ve taken this detachment of archers by surprise, do as much damage as you can before they regroup."
scenario_travel_nasitra_start_2,You’ll need to kill enough of them to break the siege. Charge!!
scenario_travel_nasitra_success,"Phew, that was a major battle, but the siege on the Bridge is now lifted. We’re almost at the coast!"
scenario_travel_nomadcamp_start_1,"I don’t think there’s anything you could do to get me within ten feet of a Lurker, let alone work with one..."
scenario_travel_nomadcamp_start_2,Inox and Lurkers working together? This is worrying.
scenario_travel_nomadcamp_start_3,"Well, I suppose we should save these nomads so they can pay u- er, help us solve this mystery of course!"
scenario_travel_nomadcamp_success_1,"With the last Inox’s blood soaking into the sand, the nomads approach you with thanks and information."
scenario_travel_nomadcamp_success_2,"They say the Lurkers made a deal with the Inox: help them recover the teeth from the nomads, and they won’t attack Kailej."
scenario_travel_nomadcamp_success_3,"Looks like the teeth are now ours, but the attack on Kailej was never called off."
scenario_travel_obsidianbluff_room3_1,Night Demons? Really?
scenario_travel_obsidianbluff_room3_2,I wonder how the Rot is spawning Demons… It might even be able to spawn a-
scenario_travel_obsidianbluff_room3_3,No.
scenario_travel_obsidianbluff_start_1,Was that some kind of... ritual?
scenario_travel_obsidianbluff_start_2,"Somehow, there’s something even more insane than Cultists?. I hate this job. Oh, why does it have to pay so well?"
scenario_travel_obsidianbluff_start_3,No one’s going to pay us anything until we put a stop to the Rot. Push through!
scenario_travel_obsidianbluff_success_1,"With the dungeon cleared of threats, you’re now able to search it."
scenario_travel_obsidianbluff_success_2,It appears that the Lurkers and Deep Terrors were indeed performing a ritual with the teeth to summon… something to create the Rot.
scenario_travel_obsidianbluff_success_3,"But try as I might, I can’t find out what these teeth are from, or what they are ultimately trying to summon. I don’t think this is over just yet…"
scenario_travel_riversrise_start_1,"You enter the first chamber to see a number of floating, burning figures, and apparently what was left of the villagers who entered the tomb before you has been ‘recruited’ into their service."
scenario_travel_riversrise_start_2,"Oooh, Sun Demons. Now I’ve never encountered these before, though I have read manuals on how to fight them."
scenario_travel_riversrise_start_3,"They are extremely accurate, so prevent damage if you can. Try and consume any Light Elements they create!"
scenario_travel_riversrise_success_1,"Great work! After all the battles I’ve seen you take part in, I’ll be able to write my own tactical manual some day."
scenario_travel_rockfall_start_1,"There is no sign of the Savvas, so we’ll just have to take down the Demons first."
scenario_travel_rockfall_start_2,"Beware, the Elements have been strengthened here and these Demons could have extra powers!"
scenario_travel_rockfall_success_1,"The Demons are destroyed, and the villagers of Rockfall begin to venture back out of their homes."
scenario_travel_sahmyrt_room_2_1,Have they got… Giant Snakes?
scenario_travel_sahmyrt_room_2_2,"Certainly looks like it - watch out, those things can jump!"
scenario_travel_sahmyrt_room_3_1,"Ah, here we are, the cause of the problem: blasted Vermling Shamans. They can curse your whole party and heal their allies, if you can, take them down fast!"
scenario_travel_sahmyrt_start_1,"You reach the village and see Vermlings, armed with bows and arrows, commanding animals."
scenario_travel_sahmyrt_success,"The main area around the trade route is now clear, although many Vermlings have retreated into deeper parts of the forest."
scenario_travel_saltmarshflats_room2_1,"That looks like the last of the Artillery there. Destroy that, mop up the stragglers, and we should be able to leave without too much trouble."
scenario_travel_saltmarshflats_room3_1,"You just HAD to jinx it, didn’t you?"
scenario_travel_saltmarshflats_room3_2,"Well, I guess a Cultist presence makes sense in a town built by magicians."
scenario_travel_saltmarshflats_room3_3,Why do the Cultists always work with people trying to kill us?
scenario_travel_saltmarshflats_room3_4,Because we aren’t the ones planning a magical world domination?
scenario_travel_saltmarshflats_room3_5,Yeah… I suppose that makes sense. Watch out for those Demons!
scenario_travel_saltmarshflats_start_1,"Well, this feels awfully familiar…"
scenario_travel_saltmarshflats_start_2,"It does, but this force is much smaller than the stockpile at Millpond."
scenario_travel_saltmarshflats_start_3,Let’s just hope they aren’t hiding anything nasty… like hidden taxes.
scenario_travel_saltmarshflats_start_4,"Destroy the Militia presence here, but be careful. There’s probably more in store than hidden taxes."
scenario_travel_saltmarshflats_success_1,"A weight lifts from the air as the last Cultist falls, but the stench of Harrower lingers."
scenario_travel_saltmarshflats_success_2,"With the battle over, you notice that Militia and Cultist bodies are not the only ones among the dead."
scenario_travel_saltmarshflats_success_3,It looks like the Harrowers killed anyone that wouldn’t join them. I’ll bet these people weren’t even asked nicely!
scenario_travel_saltmarshflats_success_4,We can not allow The Council of Shadow to kill any more people. We need to move now
scenario_travel_schoolofthegreatoak_sm1_desc,At the Start of each round All Elements are set to Inert
scenario_travel_schoolofthegreatoak_start_1,The combination of demonic influence and necromancy has nullified all other magic in the area.
scenario_travel_schoolofthegreatoak_start_2,"All Elements will be set to null at the end of every turn, so you won’t be able to rely on your more powerful magic in this fight!"
scenario_travel_schoolofthegreatoak_success_1,"As the last enemy is destroyed, you see the rot begin to withdraw, and your magic fires back to life."
scenario_travel_schoolofthegreatoak_success_2,"I’d hope that’s the last we’ll see of the Night Demons, but I know that won’t be the case."
scenario_travel_scurvybay_room2_1,The Harrowers have grouped up with some Savvas here - you’ll have to be extra careful.
scenario_travel_scurvybay_start_1,There’s something so… deliciously wrong about this whole situation. It’s just like committing tax fraud.
scenario_travel_scurvybay_start_2,"Yes, I can see the irony. You’ll have to fight alongside the bandits today!"
scenario_travel_scurvybay_start_3,Wait… how do you know what committing tax fraud is like?
scenario_travel_scurvybay_start_4,"Oh I’m, er, imagining of course."
scenario_travel_scurvybay_success_1,"The bandits stare at you as the last Militia soldier falls. They seem to have accepted you, for now."
scenario_travel_scurvybay_success_2,"Well, they have agreed to join our cause for revenge. Good work, we have our army."
scenario_travel_scurvybay_success_3,We just need to get them something sharp to wave about so we can stop this Council doing the thing it’s doing.
scenario_travel_shaderest_start_1,"Ah, Cultists. They may look relatively harmless at first glance, but you need to eliminate them as soon as possible as they have the ability to raise the undead."
scenario_travel_shaderest_start_2,"That said, if mortally wounded they can die in the process!"
scenario_travel_shaderest_start_3,"Also, be aware that due to the powerful energies they are invoking, they sometimes have a tendency to explode when killed... so depending on how volatile they are looking, maybe stand back?"
scenario_travel_shaderest_success,"This branch of the Cult is no more, but they are still active in other parts of the realm. This won't be the last you’ll see of them!"
scenario_travel_shadowfieldmanor_sm1_desc,At the Start of each round the Dark Element is set to Strong and the Light Element is set to Inert
scenario_travel_shadowfieldmanor_start_1,Dark Power has always been said to warp around this area of the forest. It entirely blots out the power of Light too. Use that to your advantage!
scenario_travel_shadowfieldmanor_success,"The cultists are driven away from the manor, which is now safe again. You are unsure whether this is a good thing or not."
scenario_travel_shimmeringshallows_room2_1,"You’re almost to the seaport, and… wait, what’s this?"
scenario_travel_shimmeringshallows_room2_2,"The Council will make all in this realm more powerful, and you will not stop them!"
scenario_travel_shimmeringshallows_room2_3,Looks like the Council have convinced more Savvas to join them. You’ll have to deal with them too.
scenario_travel_shimmeringshallows_start_1,"Damn! It looks like this Council of Shadows knew you would come... They work faster than my town council does though, I’ll give them that."
scenario_travel_shimmeringshallows_start_2,"Fortunately this garrison doesn’t look too big, you should be able to retake the seaport yourselves."
scenario_travel_shimmeringshallows_success_1,"As the last defender falls, silence falls too, and the port workers slowly appear from their hiding spots."
scenario_travel_shimmeringshallows_success_2,I don’t like how organised this Militia is… It almost feels as though Keyport is at war.
scenario_travel_shimmeringshallows_success_3,"Thankfully, the townspeople are happy to support us in our attack. We can finally put an end to this Council and their violence."
scenario_travel_silverwick_start_1,"You reach a clearing in the forest which contains the entrance to a cave. There are pools or lava and rubble dotted everywhere, you’ll need to mind your step!"
scenario_travel_silverwick_success_1,"With the Demons dead, the route to Silverwick should be clear again."
scenario_travel_southshield_start_1,"A motley group of Vermlings and Inox burst out of the undergrowth, and you can hear more in the distance. Prepare for a large attack!"
scenario_travel_southshield_start_2,"This is a rag-tag bunch of enemies. Although there are a lot of them, survive for long enough and they’ll likely lose heart."
scenario_travel_southshield_success,"As another enemy falls, the remaining adversaries turn tail and flee, their morale broken. You consider giving chase, but the forest is too dense and getting lost is a definite possibility."
scenario_travel_spitepeak_savvas_objective,Kill All Enemy Savvas
scenario_travel_spitepeak_start_1,"As expected, there is a welcoming party for you as you enter the tower."
scenario_travel_spitepeak_start_2,Your meddling must come to an end. The Savvas are the master race and will not be polluted by others living here.
scenario_travel_spitepeak_start_3,It looks as if more of the doors in this tower are blocked off by pressure plates. You’ll need to be smart to work your way through it.
scenario_travel_spitepeak_success,"With the Savvas killed, the Demons return to their own realm."
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_room2_1,"Ah, Night Demons. That would explain the powerful Dark presence."
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_room2_2,"As long as they aren’t Stone Golems, I’m quite happy."
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_room2_3,Night Demons and Stone Golems? I don’t think the Council is strong enough to command both!
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_room4_1,I think we may have spoken too soon.
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_room4_2,Just kill it. I don’t want to look at it
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_room4_3,"Once it’s dead, prepare yourselves. The doors to the keep are on the other side of this room!"
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_room5_1,I expected the Council of Shadow to be a little more… impressive?
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_room5_2,"You have stood in the way of our gifts long enough, vermin. Your interference ends here."
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_room5_3,"You must make sure it is their interference that ends here, not ours!"
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_sm1_desc,At the Start of each round the Dark Element is set to Strong and the Light Element is set to Inert
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_start_1,Both groups should clear a way to the keep; you’re going to need all your strength to defeat the Council.
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_start_2,You’d think such a strong Council would have stronger walls on their hideout…
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_start_3,"They did drain the Light out of this place, though. Be careful: Light is Null here, and Dark is Strong."
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_success_1,"Now the Council are dead, you notice the scattered documents around their keep."
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_success_2,It seems from these documents that the Council believed controlling the population would have caused less wars.
scenario_travel_staybrightfort_success_3,You mean these stinking clouds actually thought they were helping?
scenario_travel_summerwell_room_2_1,The temperature in here is even lower than outside!
scenario_travel_summerwell_room_2_2,Frost Demons! They must be the cause of the Blizzard. You need to destroy them!
scenario_travel_summerwell_start_1,"It seems a family of bears and some hounds have taken shelter, and they are not happy to see you!"
scenario_travel_summerwell_start_2,"If we are stuck here for any time, we’ll need to deal with these creatures and anything else in the rest of the network of caves."
scenario_travel_summerwell_success_1,The last Frost Demon falls and the temperature of the cave instantly rises to simply ‘cold’.
scenario_travel_summerwell_success_2,"As expected, crystals lie scattered in the rear part of the cave. It seems the Savvas were expecting you to follow on this route."
scenario_travel_sweetwater_room2_1,Deep Terrors too?
scenario_travel_sweetwater_room2_2,Watch out for… whatever it is they do!
scenario_travel_sweetwater_room3_1,How did the smell get WORSE!?
scenario_travel_sweetwater_room3_2,It seems like some kind of... Rot blocking the sewage - hopefully killing these creatures will clear it.
scenario_travel_sweetwater_start_1,"Well, this is nothing like the paintings."
scenario_travel_sweetwater_start_2,Are those… Black Imps?
scenario_travel_sweetwater_start_3,They look like living sewage!
scenario_travel_sweetwater_success_1,"With the creatures dead, the Rot shrivels away and the sewage begins to flow properly again. In the rot’s place, spoiled spring water seeps through cracks in the sewer walls."
scenario_travel_sweetwater_success_2,"I think the source of this rot runs deeper. Have a wash, and we’ll investigate further."
scenario_travel_sweetwater_success_3,"Whatever this rot is, I’m not going anywhere near a sewer again."
scenario_travel_templeoftheacorn_sm1_desc,All enemies have Poison added to their Attacks
scenario_travel_templeoftheacorn_start_1,These dogs look diseased. Be aware they have POISON on all their attacks.
scenario_travel_templeoftheacorn_start_2,"I’m pretty sure that if you can survive long enough, they’ll turn tail and run."
scenario_travel_templeoftheacorn_success_1,"Unable to break your resolve, the remaining hounds slink into the shadows and leave the tomb, scattering into the desert beyond."
scenario_travel_templeoftheacorn_success_2,Poisonous Hounds are even worse than normal Hounds... why don’t people just own a cat like I do?
scenario_travel_thebarrencoast_start_1,"As expected, out of the bushes stomp some very angry-looking Inox. You try to communicate with them, but to no avail. They prepare to attack."
scenario_travel_thebarrencoast_start_2,"It seems some of my less cultured cousins are going to mess with your day. Treat Inox as big angry humans - they aren’t too difficult to take down, unless they bring their Shaman along."
scenario_travel_thebarrencoast_success,"With the tribe defeated, your path from the forest is no longer barred. You continue to the Barren Coast."
scenario_travel_theburiedtrenches_room3_1,"That looks like the same Rot we found in Sweetwater, but it doesn’t appear to be the source."
scenario_travel_theburiedtrenches_room3_2,It stinks the same. Do you think these creatures travel through the Rot?
scenario_travel_theburiedtrenches_room3_3,"Maybe… but they are definitely connected. Finish clearing the reservoir, and we’ll investigate further."
scenario_travel_theburiedtrenches_start_1,"Well, there’s no doubt that these reservoirs are contaminated too."
scenario_travel_theburiedtrenches_start_2,"I thought Oozes were just tall tales made up by drunken idiots, wrong again!"
scenario_travel_theburiedtrenches_start_3,"The Rot’s source is likely further inside. Push through, and watch the Oozes - they spread fast."
scenario_travel_theburiedtrenches_success_1,"With the Rot cleared, the stench of stale water dominates. The reservoir stays dirty."
scenario_travel_theburiedtrenches_success_2,"A southern river feeds this reservoir. It passes by the Inox settlement of Kailej, so we’ll head in that direction."
scenario_travel_thecityofslate_start_1,"Well, this is new to me... Undead with flaming bows?"
scenario_travel_thecityofslate_start_2,It looks as if their arrow heads may be explosive. Try and split up if possible!
scenario_travel_thecityofslate_success,"It seems they return to the dust like any other Undead. Now, let’s see what the archaeologists can reward us with!"
scenario_travel_thecopperoasis_start_1,"The Vermlings have made a simple camp here, and the Oasis is littered with their rubbish. As you step into view, they grab their weapons and attack."
scenario_travel_thecopperoasis_success,"With the last Vermling dead, the Oasis is a safe place for travellers once more."
scenario_travel_thedome_start_1,"You certainly expected to find Cultists down here, of course in the garb of the Umbran League. What you didn’t expect were Night Demons!"
scenario_travel_thedome_start_2,"It seems they are not content with raising the dead, but are now in collusion with Demons. They must be stopped!"
scenario_travel_thedome_success_1,Peace returns to the Dome after its most recent battle for decades is now over.
scenario_travel_theenclave_hound_objective,Lose if both Elite Hounds die
scenario_travel_theenclave_sm1_desc,All animals are permanently Strengthened.
scenario_travel_theenclave_start_1,"In the first cavern, you find the Mayor’s Hounds locked in cages and quickly free them, using the commands he taught you to ensure they don’t attack."
scenario_travel_theenclave_start_2,"Just then, Bandits come in from another Cavern."
scenario_travel_theenclave_start_3,"‘Who are you lot? Oh bugger, they’ve let those Hounds free! Quick, get them!’"
scenario_travel_theenclave_start_4,Bandits and other animals come into the cavern. It looks like you’ll have to fight your way out.
scenario_travel_theenclave_start_5,"All the animals here seem to be acting strangely. I think they’ve been injected with something. You better look after those Hounds too - if they don’t make it, the Mayor isn’t going to be happy!"
scenario_travel_theenclave_success_1,"It seems the Bandits were trying out a strange elemental magic on these animals, that’s why they were all Strengthened."
scenario_travel_theenclave_success_2,Better take the Mayor’s Hounds back and get out of here.
scenario_travel_thehermitage_start_1,Scientists eh? I’d never mess with necromancy.
scenario_travel_thehermitage_start_2,Because you don’t understand magic and are terrified of the undead?
scenario_travel_thehermitage_start_3,"Well, that, and there isn’t a great return on investment. Also, some of the corpses end up looking like a particularly unpleasant uncle I used to have."
scenario_travel_thehermitage_success,"With the Undead returned to peace, you climb the stairs to the top of the tower to explain to the Quatryl the error of his ways."
scenario_travel_thehole_start_1,You climb down into the temple. Wind howls down the corridors and there is a bitter chill in the air.
scenario_travel_thehole_start_2,More Demons. Also the door looks... locked?
scenario_travel_thehole_start_3,I believe it’s an ancient Savvas security system. You’ll need to stand on all pressure pads in a room to open the next door.
scenario_travel_thehole_start_4,Okay. Let’s clear out all the rooms and see what the Savvas wanted here.
scenario_travel_thehole_success,"The Temple is quiet once more, and you take your time looking around for clues."
scenario_travel_thepyre_start_1,"Oh dear, you have awoken some Living Spirits, the souls of those who died suddenly and unhappily."
scenario_travel_thepyre_start_2,Isn’t all death unhappy?
scenario_travel_thepyre_start_3,"… Spirits have a resistance to damage, so you'll find attacks with Pierce more effective. They also fly, so the Traps won't help!"
scenario_travel_thepyre_success,"As the sun rises, the undead fall to the ground and you leave the tomb and its terrors. You then pile up stones over the entrance, so that no one else awakens the restless dead."
scenario_travel_theshiftingsands_room3_1,What are Lurkers doing so far from the sea? Is nowhere safe!?
scenario_travel_theshiftingsands_room3_2,Lurkers are a dangerous and intelligent race… there must be a reason they are going to such lengths for these teeth.
scenario_travel_theshiftingsands_start_1,There is no Rot here. What has drawn the Black Imps?
scenario_travel_theshiftingsands_start_2,Maybe the teeth are important to the Imps?
scenario_travel_theshiftingsands_start_3,"Hmm, possibly. Regroup as quickly as you can: there’s no telling what followed the imps here..."
scenario_travel_theshiftingsands_success_1,"As the last Lurker falls into the sand, an uneasy peace falls over the camp."
scenario_travel_theshiftingsands_success_2,Violent Lurkers this far from the ocean’s depths are a bad sign. We must make haste to the Inox.
scenario_travel_theshiftingsands_success_3,"What about the nomads? They might have some mone- I mean, information?"
scenario_travel_theshiftingsands_success_4,"That is true, but it would be a detour. I’d have to consider it further."
scenario_travel_thesloshedsquirrel_start_1,"What the… Bandits working with Vermlings? These guys are going to have a lot of ranged attacks, best get up close and personal!"
scenario_travel_thesloshedsquirrel_success,"As the last bow falls to the ground, you patch your wounds and head off towards the pub."
scenario_travel_thethorngate_room_2,"Entering this cavern, you find the source of the music: a group of Imps generating the magical melody. Although the children are not here, you feel that they are nearby."
scenario_travel_thethorngate_start_1,The cave leads down to a room protected by stone guardians and the air is infused with magic that should boost any Healing abilities.
scenario_travel_thethorngate_start_2,"Beware, those Golems have a healing aura on them! You’ll have to work hard to take them down."
scenario_travel_thethorngate_success_1,"With the last enemy dead, the music abruptly stops and you immediately hear the sounds of voices from the rear of the cavern."
scenario_travel_thethorngate_success_2,"After a short search, you detect an illusion placed on the area hiding an entranceway to an antechamber with a group of children inside."
scenario_travel_thethorngate_success_3,"They seem scared, but unharmed. You lead them back to the town"
scenario_travel_toadmoor_start_1,"Drakes, this far east? Something must have made them leave the mountains!"
scenario_travel_toadmoor_start_2,"Beware their poison, and the walking ones have a ferocious set of bites. Attack from range if you can."
scenario_travel_toadmoor_success,I expect the harsh winter has driven them to forage further for food. Expect more Drake encounters across the realm.
scenario_travel_wayfarersrest_start_1,"This is a Bounty mission, which means to succeed you will need to kill a certain number of enemies."
scenario_travel_wayfarersrest_start_2,"The good news is that the whole battle will take place in this single clearing, the bad news is that enemies will keep spawning until you kill enough."
scenario_travel_wayfarersrest_success,"Good Job, I don’t think they’ll be coming back in a hurry!"
scenario_travel_wayfarersrest_win_objective,
scenario_travel_wayward_start_1,"You raise your eyes and see Imps in the clearing, and something you’ve not encountered before."
scenario_travel_wayward_start_2,"Wind Demons! I should have guessed, with that strange weather..."

tutorial_2_text_011_1,"Whilst hovered, you can see the <color=#C53F3F><b>Bandit</b></color>'s intentions this round: he plans to <color=#FADC99><b>Move</b></color> and <color=#FADC99><b>Attack</b></color>!

Whereas player characters get two <color=#FADC99><b>actions</b></color> per turn, monsters only get one - albeit often with multiple <color=#FADC99><b>abilities</b></color> within."

As it is currently the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color>’s turn however, you'll get to finish his turn before the <color=#C53F3F><b>Bandit</b></color> can act."
tutorial_2_text_011_3,"Let's get the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color> close enough to use the <color=#FADC99><b>Attack</b></color> on <nobr><b><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#f5e3b0>Trample</color></font></b>'s</nobr> top half as the second <color=#FADC99><b>action</b></color> for the turn!"

In this case you can see above the <color=#C53F3F><b>Bandit Guard</b></color> that a <b><color=#FFA414>+0</color></b> modifier was drawn, so your <color=#FADC99><b>Attack</b></color> still just deals its base value of <b>3</b> damage."
tutorial_2_text_015_2,"For this tutorial, we will only have <b><color=#FFA414>+0</color></b> modifiers in effect to keep things simple. We'll explore the other <color=#FADC99><b>attack modifiers</b></color> later!"
tutorial_2_text_016_1,"Now it is the <color=#C53F3F><b>Bandit</b></color>’s turn. As we saw on his card earlier, he intends to <color=#FADC99><b>Move</b></color> and then perform a melee <color=#FADC99><b>Attack</b></color> for <b>3</b> damage. 

However, as he is already within melee range of the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color>, he will simply forgo moving and get straight to the <color=#FADC99><b>Attack</b></color>."
tutorial_2_text_016_2,"Ouch! While monsters always take damage directly to their hit points, whenever a player character is damaged, you are presented with three options:"
tutorial_2_text_016_3,"Firstly, you can simply take the damage to your character's hit point total. However, if this is reduced to <b>0</b>, this character is <color=#FADC99><b>exhausted</b></color>, which means they can no longer act in this scenario.

If all of your mercenaries are <color=#FADC99><b>exhausted</b></color>, you will lose the scenario!"
tutorial_2_text_016_4,"Secondly, you can choose to <color=#FADC99><b>burn</b></color> two discarded ability cards instead of receiving the damage. If you <color=#FADC99><b>burn</b></color> a card it can no longer be recovered by resting."
tutorial_2_text_016_5,"However, if you were to <color=#FADC99><b>burn</b></color> two of <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color>'s cards here, he would not have enough cards left for the following turn, and thus would be <color=#FADC99><b>exhausted</b></color>!"
tutorial_2_text_016_6,"Finally, you can choose to <color=#FADC99><b>burn</b></color> one available card. This option is greyed out as all of the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color>'s cards are currently discarded."
tutorial_2_text_016_7,"It is usually wise to take the damage over <color=#FADC99><b>burn</b></color>ing cards if possible, lest you run out of cards to finish the scenario with!

For now, let's opt to just take the three damage, as the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color> has enough health to survive."
tutorial_2_text_017,"The <color=#C53F3F><b>Bandit</b></color>’s turn is now over. As he was the last character to act, it is the end of the round, and a new round begins."
tutorial_2_text_018_1,"During ability card selection, if you have at least two discarded cards then you may perform a <color=#FADC99><b>Long</b></color> or <color=#FADC99><b>Short Rest</b></color> to recover some of them.

All of the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color>'s ability cards are currently discarded (<color=#FADC99><b>Long Rest</b></color> doesn't count as a card) and as such he will have to rest to continue."
tutorial_2_text_018_2,"<color=#FADC99><b>Short Rest</b></color> will burn one of your discarded cards at random, losing it for the rest of the scenario, but will recover all other discarded cards before continuing your turn as normal - so you can recover cards to use immediately in this very turn."
tutorial_2_text_018_3,"<color=#FADC99><b>Long Rest</b></color> takes up the whole turn, and is used instead of selecting two ability cards, giving the character an initiative of <b>99</b>. However, you not only get to choose which card to burn instead of it being at random, but the character will perform a ""<b>Heal 2</b>"" action and refresh all item cards!"
tutorial_2_text_018_4,"Choosing to <color=#FADC99><b>Long Rest</b></color> here would be certain death if the <color=#C53F3F><b>Bandit</b></color> draws an attack card for the round, as the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color> has neither health nor cards to spare, so let's choose to <color=#FADC99><b>Short Rest</b></color>."
tutorial_2_text_019,"<nobr><b><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr> has been randomly selected as the card to burn.

Once per short rest you can opt to redraw the random card to burn at the cost of one damage, but with the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color> only on 1 health, this isn’t an option!"
tutorial_2_text_020_1,"You can see <nobr><b><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#f5e3b0>Grab and Go</color></font></b></nobr> is now dark red to indicate it is burned and no longer usable in the current scenario."
tutorial_2_text_020_2,"In exchange, <nobr><b><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#f5e3b0>Trample</color></font></b></nobr> and <nobr><b><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr> have been returned to hand and are available to use again!"
tutorial_2_text_020_3,"Both the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color> and the <color=#C53F3F><b>Bandit</b></color> are near-death, so it is crucial to go as early as possible in the round to get the first attack!

Remember, the first card you choose determines the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color>’s initiative, so let's choose <nobr><b><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr> to maximise the chance <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color> is up first with a low initiative of <b>10</b>."
tutorial_2_text_022,"Now that we are in the same room as the <color=#C53F3F><b>Bandit</b></color>, we can see that enemies draw their ability cards each round after the player(s), so you won't know what they'll be doing or what their initiatives will be until this point in each round.

It appears the <color=#C53F3F><b>Bandit</b></color> was planning to once again use a <color=#FADC99><b>Move</b></color> and an <color=#FADC99><b>Attack</b></color>, but because you chose to act quickly with an initiative of <b>10</b>, he won't have those active until after the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color>'s turn due to a slower initiative of <b>50</b>! Let's get him!"
tutorial_2_text_024_1,"Got him! Do you see that gold on the floor that the <color=#C53F3F><b>Bandit</b></color> left behind? To pick it up, you need to use a <color=#FADC99><b>Loot</b></color> ability. 

One important rule of <b>Gloomhaven</b> to bear in mind is that you don’t automatically loot treasure - if you want it, you'll have to pick it up before the scenario ends!"
tutorial_2_text_024_2,"<color=#FADC99><b>Loot</b></color> abilities can appear on ability cards, but often the easiest way to collect it is to end your turn on a hex that contains a gold pile.

So, let's move the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color> onto the gold before the end of his turn with his remaining action!"
tutorial_2_text_024_3,"But, wait... look at <nobr><b><font=""MarcellusAlt SDF""><color=#f5e3b0>Provoking Roar</color></font></b></nobr>.

It doesn't have a <color=#FADC99><b>Move</b></color> ability on the bottom half's action, so how can the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color> reach the gold?"
tutorial_2_text_024_4,"This is where <color=#FADC99><b>default actions</b></color> come in handy! To the left and right of the central initiative value are two small <color=#FADC99><b>default action</b></color> buttons.

These allow the character to perform a melee <color=#FADC99><b>Attack</b></color> for <b>2</b> instead of the top action or a default <color=#FADC99><b>Move</b></color> of <b>2</b> instead of the bottom action."
tutorial_2_text_024_5,"Since you only need to <color=#FADC99><b>Move</b></color> one hex for the <color=#a06e4b><b>Brute</b></color> to reach the gold, we can skip the remaining movement using the skip button below."
tutorial_2_text_025_1,"Great work! Not only did you vanquish the, err... lone <color=#C53F3F><b>Bandit Guard</b></color>, you’ve even managed to pick up a few pieces of gold!"
tutorial_2_text_025_2,"With the basics covered, it's now time to introduce you to some slightly more dangerous scenarios..."
